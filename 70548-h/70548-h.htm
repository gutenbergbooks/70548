<span class="sc">t</span> is now a little more than six years since this publication was commenced, and
the completion of the Sixth Volume enables me to say that nearly every Parody
of literary merit, or importance, has been mentioned in its pages, whilst some
<em>thousands</em> of the best have been given in full.</p>

<p>To form such a collection required not only an intimate knowledge of English
Poetical Literature, but involved the reference to many very rare and scarce books,
English, American, and Colonial.</p>

<p>I beg to offer my sincere thanks to the Authors who kindly permitted their
copyright poems to be inserted in this volume, particularly to F. Locker-Lampson, Esq.,
and G. R. Sims, Esq., as well as to the following gentlemen, for copies of Parodies and
other information they have afforded&mdash;Messrs. Cuthbert Bede, G. H. Brierley, of Cardiff;
F. W. Crawford, T. F. Dillon Croker, Frank Howell, J. H. Ingram, Walter Parke, F. B.
Perkins, of San Francisco; C. H. Stephenson, C. H. Waring, and Gleeson White.</p>

<p>In nearly every case the permission of the authors has been obtained for the
re-publication of their Parodies; in the few instances where this was not done, it was
owing to the impossibility of finding the author’s address.</p>

<p>During the progress of the work, some further Parodies appeared of Authors already
dealt with, it is proposed to include these in a supplementary volume, which will be
published at some future date.</p>

<p>It is believed that the ample Bibliographical information relating to Parodies and
Burlesques contained in this volume will be specially useful to Librarians, Managers of
Penny Readings, and Professors of Elocution.</p>

<p>Editors of Provincial Papers who offer prizes for Literary compositions should be on
their guard against unscrupulous persons who copy Parodies from this Collection, and
send them in as <em>original compositions</em>.</p>

<p>In much of the compilation, and especially those portions requiring the exercise of
taste, and in the somewhat dreary process of proof reading, I have been greatly assisted by
my wife, whose cheerful co-operation in all my labours adds just the zest which
renders Life worth living.</p>

<p>Whilst bidding my subscribers <cite>Farewell</cite>, I wish to add that the subject of Parodies
will continue to engage my attention, and that I shall always be grateful for any
information, or examples, that may be sent to me, addressed to the care of Messrs.
Reeves and Turner.</p>

<span class="sc">r. Swinburne</span>, son of Admiral
Charles Henry Swinburne, and
grandson of Sir John Edward
Swinburne, sixth baronet, was born
in 1838, and educated first at Eton, and
afterwards at Oxford.</p>

<p>Despite his ancient pedigree, his aristocratic
connections, and his university education, the
early writings of Mr. A. C. Swinburne, both in
prose and verse, were coloured by Radical
opinions of the most advanced description.
Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth and Southey commenced
thus, with results which should have
taught him how unwise it is for a poet, who
wishes to be widely read, to descend into the
heated atmosphere of political strife.</p>

<p><cite>The Undergraduate Papers</cite>, published by Mr.
Mansell, Oxford, 1857-8, contained some of
Mr. Swinburne’s earliest poems, these were
followed by “Atalanta in Calydon,” “Chastelard,”
and “Poems and Ballads.”</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that only a few
brief extracts can be given from Mr. Swinburne’s
poems, sufficient merely to strike the
key notes of the Parodies.</p>

<div class="i2">Fire, and the falling of tears,</div>
<div class="i1">And a measure of sliding sand</div>

<div class="i2">The holy spirit of man.</div>
<div class="i1">For the winds of the north and the south</div>
<div class="i2">They gathered as into strife;</div>
<div class="i1">They breathed upon his mouth,</div>
<div class="i2">They filled his body with life;</div>
<div class="i1">Eyesight and speech they wrought</div>
<div class="i2">For the veils of the soul therein,</div>
<div class="i1">A time for labour and thought,</div>
<div class="i2">A time to serve and to sin;</div>
<div class="i1">They gave him light in his ways,</div>
<div class="i2">And love, and a space for delight,</div>
<div class="i1">And beauty and length of days,</div>
<div class="i2">And night, and sleep in the night.</div>
<div class="i1">His speech is a burning fire;</div>
<div class="i2">With his lips he travaileth;</div>
<div class="i1">In his heart is a blind desire,</div>
<div class="i2">In his eyes foreknowledge of death;</div>
<div class="i1">He weaves, and is clothed with derision;</div>
<div class="i2">Sows, and he shall not reap;</div>
<div class="i1">His life is a watch or a vision</div>

<p>The peculiar metre in which “Dolores” and the Dedication
of the “Poems and Ballads” Volume are written,
although it invites parody, is difficult to imitate successfully.
The ending line of each stanza abruptly cut short is a trick in
composition which few but Mr. Swinburne himself have
thoroughly mastered.</p>

<p>The following stanzas from the Dedication will enable
readers to perceive how closely they have been parodied by
Mr. Pollock.</p>

<p>This “J. S.” was a mythical person introduced for the
purposes of illustration, and constantly met with in old law
books and reports. His devotion to Rome is shown by his
desperate attempts to get there in three days: “If J. S.
shall go to Rome in three days,” was then a standing
example of an impossible condition, which modern science
has robbed of most of its point.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">THE BALLAD OF BURDENS.</p>

<p>This poem will be found on page 144 of Mr. Swinburne’s
<cite>Poems and Ballads</cite> (first series). It is one of his best known
ballads, and in 1879 it was chosen by the editor of <cite>The World</cite>
as the model on which to found parodies describing the wet
and gloomy summer of that year.</p>

<p>The successful poems in the competition were printed in
<cite>The World</cite>, July 16, 1879. The first prize was won by a well
known London Architect, the second by a Dublin gentleman
who has since published several amusing Volumes of light
poems.</p>

<div class="i1">The burden of Old Women. They delight</div>
<div class="i2">In bulky bundles, always in the way;</div>
<div class="i1">In ’busses close they wedge you tight at night,</div>
<div class="i2">In railway trains they jam you up by day.</div>
<div class="i2">Plump dames with pulpy cheeks and locks of grey,</div>
<div class="i1">In weariness they waddle, puff, perspire.</div>
<div class="i2">To banish them for ever one would say,</div>
<div class="i1">This must be every busy man’s desire.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">The burden of Sad Colours. Thou shalt see</div>
<div class="i2">Gold tarnished, ghostly grey, and livid green,</div>
<div class="i1">And lank and languorous thy face must be</div>
<div class="i2">To harmonise with the lugubrious scene.</div>
<div class="i2">And thou shalt say of scarlet, “It have been,”</div>
<div class="i1">And sighing of old tints and tones shalt tire.</div>
<div class="i2">To bring back brightness and to banish spleen,</div>
<div class="i1">This must be every cheerful man’s desire.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The burden of Smart Sayings. In this day</div>
<div class="i2">All wish as cynic wits to bear the bell.</div>
<div class="i1">Men mock at honour, justice, love, and say</div>
<div class="i2"><em>The</em> end of life “good stories” is to tell.</div>
<div class="i2">The cad’s coarse jest, the cackle of the swell</div>
<div class="i1">Are much alike, things that the most admire.</div>
<div class="i2">To patter slang and tell side-splitters well,</div>
<div class="i1">This is the end of every fool’s desire.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The burden of Bad Seasons. Rain in Spring,</div>
<div class="i2">Chill rain and wind among the budding trees,</div>
<div class="i1">A Summer of grey storm-clouds gathering,</div>
<div class="i2">Damp Autumn one dull mist of miseries,</div>
<div class="i2">With showers that soak, and blasts that bite and freeze;</div>
<div class="i1">A drenching Winter with north-easters dire.</div>
<div class="i2">To make an end of seasons such as these,</div>
<div class="i1">This must be every suffering man’s desire.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The burden of Strange Crazes. Woman’s right</div>
<div class="i2">To throng the polls, and join the spouting bands;</div>
<div class="i1">Theosophy and astral bodies, sleight</div>
<div class="i2">Of cunning jugglers from far foreign lands;</div>
<div class="i2">Buddhistic bosh which no one understands,</div>
<div class="i1">A thousand fads that ’gainst good sense conspire.</div>
<div class="i2">To gag the crotcheteers and tie their hands,</div>
<div class="i1">This must be every sober man’s desire.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">L’<span class="sc">Envoy.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Donkeys, and ye whom frenzy quickeneth,</div>
<div class="i2">Heed well this rhyme. Life’s many burdens tire.</div>
<div class="i1">To lighten them a little, ere our death,</div>
<div class="i2">This must be every kindly man’s desire.</div>

<p class="p2 center ls">A MATCH.</p>

<p>One of the cleverest parodies on Swinburne was written
by the late Mr. Tom Hood, the younger, on the above
named poem, and first appeared in <cite>Fun</cite>, whence it has
frequently been copied without proper acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The parody will be better appreciated after reading a
few stanzas of the original which, as will be observed, is
written in a difficult and very uncommon metre:</p>

<p>As a parody this is scarcely inferior to that of Mr. Tom
Hood, but the poet has let the sound run away from the
sense, and has forgotten that a wit who is <em>always</em> a radiant
wit is apt to become tiresome; whilst if “wine were always
iced,” all red wines would greatly suffer, especially Port and
Burgundy.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“But we wish to get away from well-trodden tracks, and
we will for once forsake our usual purely didactic groove in
order that we may give our readers an idea of what we regard
as artistic drollery, Take this dreadful imitation of
Mr. Swinburne’s manner. The parodist seems to have
genuinely enjoyed his work; and we have no doubt but that
Mr. Swinburne laughed as heartily as anybody. The poet
is supposed to be attending a wedding of distinguished
persons in Westminster Abbey, and the naughty scoffer represents
him as bursting forth with the following rather
alarming clarion <span class="lock">call&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote unindent">A masterpiece! And there is not a touch of malignity in the
lines; the poet’s curious way of writing occasionally in the
Hebraic style, his vagueness, his peculiar mode of procuring
musical effects, are all picked out and shown with a smile.
No one has quite equalled Caldecott, but this anonymous
wit runs him hard.”</p>

<p>The following parody appeared in <cite>The Tomahawk</cite>
(London) on the occasion of a visit paid by Ada Isaacs
Menken to M. Alexandre Dumas, in Paris. “Miss
Menken,” who was really the wife of John C. Heenan
the pugilist, will be best remembered for her appearance
(in very scanty attire) as “Mazeppa,” at Astley’s Theatre.
She had a fine stage appearance, but was a very indifferent
actress. She published a small volume of poems,
entitled <cite>Infelicia</cite>, which is now eagerly sought after by
collectors, because it contains an introduction written by
Charles Dickens.</p>

<div class="i1">Across his pagan path, burning his very heart;</div>
<div class="i1">Flicking the flies from off her heaving flanks,</div>
<div class="i1">The amorous flies who fill their lips with blood;</div>
<div class="i1">And while his life-blood riots in his hocks,</div>

<div class="i1">For I have felt a joy new-born to pain!</div>
<div class="i1">For I have seen that silken syren glide</div>
<div class="i1">Across the desert, hight old Astley’s Fane.</div>
<div class="i1">My breast could hardly flutter as she came</div>
<div class="i1">Bare-backed before my timorous sight; my nails</div>
<div class="i1">Curved inward to my palms, and such a sweet</div>
<div class="i1">Soft tremor crept around my nervous knees.</div>
<div class="i1">I swooned but for the kindly guardian of the box,</div>
<div class="i1">Who brought me welcome water at my wish,</div>
<div class="i1">And damped my throbbing temples.</div>
<div class="i8">On my bed</div>
<div class="i1">I rolled and rioted in frenzied fret,</div>
<div class="i1">For turn howe’er I would, upon the walls,</div>
<div class="i1">Across the sheets, the beauteous Ada rode,</div>
<div class="i1">Scenting the air with black-head clustering hair,</div>
<div class="i1">Loading the senses with soft-thrilling sighs;</div>
<div class="i1">While through the rosy lips pale pearls of teeth</div>
<div class="i1">Flashed hungrily. Strapped to her showy steed,</div>
<div class="i1">She bites her charger in the side, till lips</div>
<div class="i1">Run red with the brave beast’s blood; and as the sting</div>
<div class="i1">Of her small fangs urges his wild career,</div>
<div class="i1">So this hot flame that chars me to the bones,</div>
<div class="i1">Spreads out the fire of jealousy, and cries,</div>
<div class="i1">Mazeppa flies across the sea to greet</div>

<p>The first edition of <cite>The British Birds</cite> soon went out of
print, and became very scarce. But in December, 1885,
Mrs. Mortimer Collins wrote a letter to the editor of Parodies,
which has now a melancholy interest:&mdash;“I believe copies of
British Birds can still be had at Mr. Bentley’s, as I brought
out a second edition there some eight years ago. Yes, there
are some parodies of Swinburne, Tennyson and Browning.
But the best known bits of the book are not parodies, unless

<p class="unindent">“and ‘Skymaking’ is another oft quoted bit. I thought,
perhaps, that you had written parodies on these; though it
seemed unlikely, because satiric verse does not lend itself to
parody. I am always interested in anything connected with
my husband’s works, because I truly believe in his genius.
I may perhaps be somewhat partial in my judgment, for
Mortimer was a more brilliant talker than writer. Day
after day I enjoyed his wit, and I used to be so sorry there
were not more to hear it: but he was quite content with his
audience of one.</p>

<p>“My husband has written many parodies. If you would
like to quote them I can refer you to them.”</p>

<p>But this kind offer of assistance was not to be fulfilled, for
Mrs. Collins complained at the end of the letter of her
failing strength, and in less than three months she passed
away.</p>

<p>In 1880, Messrs. Chatto and Windus, of Piccadilly,
published an anonymous volume of Poems, entitled “<cite>The
Heptalogia</cite>, or the seven against sense, a cap with Seven
Bells.” In this there are parodies of Robert Browning,
Tennyson, Coventry Patmore, and others, but it is more than
doubtful whether the general public appreciated the sarcasm
of these clever skits. Amongst reading men much curiosity
was felt as to the author, but in answer to enquiries on the
subject, the publishers replied they were not at liberty to
mention the author’s name. Eventually public opinion assigned
the work to Mr. Swinburne, although it contains an
exquisite parody on his own style, entitled <cite>Nephelidia</cite>. This
is a charming specimen of rhythmical, musical nonsense.
A few of the opening lines may be quoted, without injury to
themselves, or to the rest of the poem, as the conclusion is
perfectly irrelevant to the beginning, or to anything <span class="lock">else:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Nephelidia.</span></div>
<div class="i1">From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn through a notable nimbus of nebulous noonshine,</div>
<div class="i1">Pallid and pink as the palm of the flag-flower that flickers with fear of the flies as they float,</div>
<div class="i1">Are they looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a marvel of mystic miraculous moonshine,</div>
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
<div class="i2">These that we feel in the blood of our blushes that thicken and threaten with throbs through the throat?</div>
<div class="i1">Thicken and thrill as a theatre thronged at appeal of an actor’s appalled agitation,</div>
<div class="i2">Fainter with fear of the fires of the future than pale with the promise of pride in the past;</div>
<div class="i1">Flushed with the famishing fullness of fever that reddens with radiance of rathe recreation,</div>
<div class="i2">Gaunt as the ghastliest of glimpses that gleam through the gloom of the gloaming when ghosts go aghast?</div>
<div class="i1">Nay, for the nick of the tick of the time is a tremulous touch on the temples of terror,</div>
<div class="i2">Strained as the sinews yet strenuous with strife of the dead who is dumb as the dust-heaps of death:</div>
<div class="i1">Surely no soul is it, sweet as the spasm of erotic emotional exquisite error,</div>
<div class="i2">Bathed in the balms of beatified bliss, beatific itself by beatitude’s breath.</div>
<div class="i1">Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft to the spirit and soul of our senses</div>
<div class="i2">Sweetens the stress of suspiring suspicion that sobs in the semblance and sound of a sigh;</div>
<div class="i1">Only this oracle opens Olympian, in mystical moods and triangular tenses&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">‘Life is the lust of a lamp for the light that is dark till the dawn of the day when we die.’</div>

<p>Another parody, which was generally attributed to
Mr. Swinburne, appeared in <cite>The Fortnightly Review</cite> for
December, 1881. It was entitled “<cite>Disgust</cite>; a Dramatic
Monologue,” and was a parody of Tennyson’s “<cite>Despair</cite>,
a Dramatic Monologue” published in <cite>The Nineteenth Century</cite>,
November, 1881.</p>

<p>The original poem contained arguments of a most
unpleasant and absurd description, these were ably ridiculed
in the burlesque, which will be found on page 184,
Volume 1, of this collection.</p>

<p>The following parody was also printed with the initials
“A. C. S.,” but clever as it is, few would venture to
assert that it was actually written by Mr. Swinburne.</p>

<p>In <cite>The World</cite> Christmas Number, 1879, there was an
exquisite satire on Mr. Burne Jones’s art entitled “The God
and the Damosel”; it was accompanied by the following
verses, and a prose criticism (too long to quote in full) written
in imitation of the intensely Æsthetic jargon familiar to the
frequenters of the Grosvenor Gallery. To fully appreciate
the poem and the criticism, the burlesque picture by Mr. E.
B. T. Burnt Bones should be seen, once seen it could never
be forgotten.</p>

<p><cite>The Criticism.</cite>&mdash;“I have judged it good and helpful to prefix
to my few words in appreciation of Mr. Bones’s noble
picture this exquisite lyric of Mr. Sinburn’s. It may serve
to a better understanding of the one master’s work to note
in what wise it has inspired the other. The scene of Mr.
Bones’s picture is a garden; the time, high noon. A damosel,
tall and gracious, stands before us, clad, but ‘more expressed
than hidden,’ in a robe of subtle tissue; which, loyal
through three parts of its length to the lines of her sinuous
figure, breaks loose round her finely-modelled knees into a
riot of enchanting curves and folds; yet, withal, an orderly
revolt, and obedient to its own higher law of rebellious
grace. At her side stands the fatal Eros, the divine, the
immortal, bow in hand, a glory of great light about his
head. Behind him rise his outspread wings, which, by
one of those eloquently significant touches whereof this
painter possesses, one must think, the exclusive secret, are
made to simulate the expanded tail of the bird of Heré.
What he has here set down for us, in reporting of the lower
limbs of this Immortal, he may well have noticed when he
himself was last set down at his own house-door; since we
see that for the knees of the young Eros of the ancients he
has not disdained to study from the ancient Kab-os of the
moderns. In the form of the maiden who bends towards
him, quivering like a shot bird at the touch of his long
lithe finger, we have another triumph of the master’s
unique powers. The mere volume of her frame is, let us
allow it, spare to the verge of the penurious; its curves
are sudden to precipitancy, abrupt even to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brusquerie</i>;
without being at all exaggerated, the charm of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">morbidezza</i>
is certainly insisted upon to the full limits of the admissible;
but the charm is there, victorious and exultant, a voluptuousness
not of the flesh, nor appealing thereto, yet a
voluptuousness the more subtle and penetrating, perhaps,
for that very reason. One sees that the burden of the
great mystery has passed upon this woman; one sees it in
the heavy-lidded eyes, in the chastened, even ascetic, lines
of the face, and above all, in the thin, almost fleshless,
figure consumed by inner fires, a conception only capable,
perhaps, of being realised in the sympathetic imagination
of a Burnt Bones. To the colour-harmonies of the whole
picture I despair of doing justice. It may be remembered
that I likened Mr. Bones’s last work to a cantata; this
one is an oratorio, full of exquisitely tuneful fancies, grand
instrumental combinations, profound contrapuntal erudition.”</p>

<p>The Banquet of the two distinct demigods is over. The
dinner, a two-franc Palais Royal feast fit for Parnassus,
came off last night; and I was there ready to watch and to
wink at the matchless mouthfuls of the two mighty Masters.
As these disappeared amidst rich rhythm and rhapsody, I
stood in a corner, note-book in hand, mutely worshipful.</p>

<p>There was a hungry hush, the Elder Master had a message
to deliver, and catching the reporter’s eye, did not halt or
hesitate.</p>

<p>“What,” he asked, addressing the lady presiding at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bureau</i> behind the little plated saucers of sugar, “what is
Swinburne? Is he,” he proceeded, “a costermonger? No.
What then. A sweep? You cannot be a sweep without
singing a <cite>Song before Sunrise</cite>. But this Swinburne has
written <cite>Chastelard</cite>. That sounds like Bacon. Is he then a
philosopher? Yes, and No. Which? Never mind. But
there is this remarkable thing about a philosopher: he
produces fruits. Sometimes they are nuts to crack, and
when Civilisation has a nut to crack it holds its jaw. This
is a paradox, and suggests the question, ‘Am I Civilisation?’
To this there is an answer. It is again ‘No and
Yes.’ Last time it was ‘Yes and No.’ Now it is ‘No
and Yes.’ Why? Is there a reason for this? None. And
when there is no reason for anything, it becomes a subject
of reference. To whom? To the Marines: and you cannot
refer a subject to the Marines without asking them a riddle.
And this is the riddle that posterity will ask them: ‘What is
Victor Hugo?’”</p>

<p>There was a pause; but in an instant the Younger Master
had sprung on to a velvet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fauteuil</i>, and, thrumming the back
of an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> dish as an impromptu lyre, with a high-piped
treble cry of “I’ll tell you,” had soon sufficiently and signally
silenced the Elder with the following unsung and understudied

<div class="i1">Ere frost-flower and snow blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight,</div>

<div class="i1">The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed.</div>
<div class="i1">Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade.</div>
<div class="i1">That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night than the day, nor the day than the night,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had the madness and might in thee made,</div>

<div class="i1">And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the snow,</div>
<div class="i1">And the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low,</div>
<div class="i1">How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the year that exults to be born.</div>
<div class="i1">So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness, whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn?</div>
<div class="i1">Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow</div>
<div class="i1">As a lover’s that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and torn,</div>
<div class="i1">Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee flow.</div>

<div class="i1">Ere frost-slush and snow-slopping dried up and went, and the horrors of Winter had slid out of sight,</div>
<div class="i1">The ways of the wood pavement fouler were far than a clay-country lane on a mucky March night.</div>
<div class="i1">The breath of the month of the winds had stabbed us through top-coats and mufflers, and made us afraid.</div>
<div class="i1">Such bronchial bothers, such blossomy noses, such frostbitten fingers for man and for maid!</div>
<div class="i1">The sea was not lovelier then than the land, each appeared in a dismal and desolate plight;</div>
<div class="i1">But the Winter is not so much worse than the Spring-time; each plays up the mischief with pleasure and trade.</div>
<div class="i1">March, master of winds, is a flatulent fraud, a marshal of banes and a bringer of blight.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And now that the rage of your rhythmical rapture, your revel of rhyming has finished its flow,</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, incontinent <span class="sc">Algernon Charles</span>, what the dickens you mean by such rubbish I <em>should</em> like to know.</div>
<div class="i1">How, how can you love and rejoice, you, leader and lord of the lyrists of curses and scorn,</div>

<div class="i1"><em>Have</em> you shaken the snow from your shoes on a doormat, with frost have your nose and your lips been aglow?</div>

<div class="i1">I sing of the months of the whirligig years that are fading far out of sight and of sound and of motionless mind;</div>
<div class="i1">Of the days without dreams and the dreams without days, and the days and the dreams and the dreams and the days grown silent and blind;</div>
<div class="i1">Gone mad with the vigor of spring and the blush of the radish new blown in the meadows far kissed by the lips of the Sound:</div>
<div class="i1">The maddest and gladdest and saddest and baddest and sweetest, completest and fleetest and neatest of days ever found.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I sing of them often in words that are winding, in adjectives blinding, in dactyles and trochees with cunning combined,</div>
<div class="i1">In lines that are long as a sentence of Evarts, in lines on the plan of the Washington Monument deftly designed;</div>
<div class="i1">With wildering fancy of words and of musical syllables weighted with little of thought and with much less of rhyme,</div>
<div class="i1">I cover ten pages a sitting with verse that has value in market, and readily getteth there every time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And when the idea is the thinnest, new burst from the void of the infinite nothing,
 the zenith of space where the nebulous ether is pregnant with cobwebs of fancy bestrewn with the dew-drops of slush,</div>
<div class="i1">I build up long lines such as never a poet, who was not a crank on the subject of versification,
 built up for the purpose of drowning a suffering public with torrents of stupid and meaningless gibbering gush.</div>
<div class="i1">If the wind and the sunlight of April and August had made of the past and hereafter a single adorable
 season whose life was a rapture of love and of laughter for all of the maidens and lads,</div>
<div class="i1">I’d write you a poem with lines like the city of Rome, and with rhymes on beholders and shoulders;
 on measure and pleasure; on closes and roses; on sterile, imperil; remember, September; and hither and thither and whither;
  on slacken and bracken; on season and reason; defrauded, applauded; on dwindled, rekindled; on giving and living;
   on slumbers and numbers; beholden and golden; on glory and story and Morey; on wizard and gizzard and blizzard;
    on Blaine and on Maine; and each rhyme would be stuck on the end of a line just like this one I’m writing;
     and oh, and heyday, and yea, marry, they’d run about eight to the page, and they’d collar the scads.</div>

<p>“According to a certain critic,” said the <cite>Daily News</cite> in
August, 1888, Mr. Swinburne “makes ‘services’ rhyme to
‘berries.’ How in the world does he manage that? Can
it be in a poem on Lawn Tennis?”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">‘Oh, thy swift, subtle, slanting, services</div>
<div class="i2">That skim the net, and ’scape the racket of me,</div>

<p class="unindent">Nothing <em>exactly</em> like this occurs in the English edition of
Mr. Swinburne’s poems, but this, perhaps, shows how the
thing could be done, if the poet were so inclined.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In the course of a singularly brilliant career it is not
surprising that Mr. Swinburne should have been the subject
of many fierce literary attacks. The history of these
feuds must await the advent of another Isaac D’Israeli
to add a Chapter to the “Calamities and Quarrels
of Authors”; interesting as the topic most certainly is,
it cannot be dealt with here. Suffice it to say that
the principal grounds for adverse criticism have been
the asserted voluptuousness and immoral tendency
of his romantic poems, and the inconsistency of his
political writings. As an instance of the latter failing
<cite>The Daily News</cite> of May 2, 1887, reprinted a poem
Mr. Swinburne wrote for <cite>The Morning Star</cite> (a Radical
paper, now defunct) in November 1867 in favour of the
Fenians then lying under sentence of death for the murder
of Serjeant Brett. This poem Mr. Swinburne had also
included in his volume, <cite>Songs before Sunrise</cite>, published in
1871, and it certainly presents a marked contrast to his
recent utterances on the Irish question.</p>

<p>As to the alleged immoral tendency of his works much
has been written, and by many pens, one of the bitterest
of his assailants being Mr. Robert Williams Buchanan,
whose own early writings were, most assuredly, open to
adverse criticism on the same ground.</p>

<p>In his little work entitled, “The Fleshly School of
Poetry,” published in 1872, Mr. Buchanan not only
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
attacked Swinburne, but he was also most malignant in
his criticisms of the poems of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, one
of the kindest, gentlest, and purest of men. The controversy
this aroused raged for some years, and the last word
was only spoken when Mr. Edmund Yates published his
article on “A Scrofulous Scotch Poet,” severely castigating
Mr. Buchanan, in <cite>The World</cite>, September 26, 1877.
Long prior to this, the following verses relating to Swinburne,
had been attributed to Buchanan. It is doubtful
whether in 1866 Mr. Swinburne’s name was sufficiently
established to entitle him to a place in such distinguished
company as is here mentioned.</p>

<div class="i1">“At the Session of Poets held lately in London,</div>
<div class="i2">The Bard of Freshwater was voted the chair:</div>
<div class="i1">With his tresses unbrush’d, and his shirt-collar undone,</div>
<div class="i2">He loll’d at his ease like a good-humour’d Bear;</div>
<div class="i1">‘Come, boys!’ he exclaimed, ‘we’ll be merry together!’</div>

<div class="i2">Some praised <cite>Ecce Homo</cite>, some deemed it so-so&mdash;</div>

<div class="i2">And looking in vain (in the mirror) for ‘Geist;’</div>
<div class="i1">He heark’d to the Chairman, with ‘Surely!’ and ‘Really?’</div>
<div class="i2">Aghast at both collar and cutty of clay,&mdash;</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Close at hand lingered Lytton, whose Icarus-winglets</div>

<div class="i1">How glitter’d the eye underneath his gray ringlets,</div>
<div class="i2">A hunger within it unlessened by time!</div>
<div class="i1">Remoter sat Bailey&mdash;satirical, surly&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Who studied the language of Goethe too soon,</div>

<div class="i2">Among misses, who sweeter than Miss Ingelow?</div>

<div class="i1">Apollo asleep on a coster-girl’s barrow,</div>
<div class="i2">Straight dragged him away to see somebody hung.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“What was said? what was done? was there prosing or rhyming?</div>
<div class="i2">Was nothing noteworthy in deed or in word?</div>
<div class="i1">Why, just as the hour for the supper was chiming,</div>
<div class="i2">The only event of the evening occurred.</div>
<div class="i1">Up jumped, with his neck stretching out like a gander,</div>
<div class="i2">Master Swinburne, and squeal’d, glaring out through his hair,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“With language so awful he dared then to treat <span class="lock">’em,&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i2">Miss Ingelow fainted in Tennyson’s arms,</div>
<div class="i1">Poor Arnold rush’d out, crying ‘Sœcl’inficetum!’</div>
<div class="i2">And great bards and small bards were full of alarms;</div>
<div class="i1">Till Tennyson, flaming and red as a gipsy,</div>
<div class="i2">Struck his fist on the table and uttered a shout:</div>
<div class="i1">‘To the door with the boy! Call a cab! He is tipsy!’</div>
<div class="i2">And they carried the naughty young gentleman out.</div>

<div class="i1">The Chairman tried hard to re-kindle the fun there,</div>
<div class="i2">But the Muses were shocked, and the pleasure was o’er.</div>
<div class="i1">Then ‘Ah!’ cried the Chairman, ‘this teaches me knowledge,</div>
<div class="i2">The future shall find me more wise, by the powers!’</div>

<p>Although this collection is avowedly confined
to Parodies which have previously appeared in
print, it will be readily understood that numbers
of <em>original</em> parodies are sent in, of which
but a very small proportion can be inserted.</p>

<p>Some amusing incidents occur, thus a short time ago a
gentlemen sent from Scotland the M.S.S. of new and
original burlesques on <cite>Hamlet</cite> and <cite>Othello</cite>, the first containing
about 850 lines, and the second about double that
number. The author earnestly requested they should be
inserted in <cite>Parodies</cite>, but whether he had succeeded in
getting any “new and original” fun out of such fresh and
lively topics as Hamlet and Othello, the world will never
be able to judge through this medium.</p>

<p>Another, and almost equally humorous request was
worded as follows:&mdash;“I enclose a parody on Mr. Algernon
Swinburne’s <cite>Dolores</cite> in the form of an encomium on
‘Someone’s Essence of Something’ which is absurdly
close to some of the original verses. If you accept it
please send proof and <em>remuneration</em> to me at above address.”</p>

<p>It so happened that this parody was not devoid of literary
merit, but the author was presuming a little too much
in expecting to get a puff inserted gratis, and to be paid
for it in the bargain.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Mr. George R. Sims was born in London on
September 2nd, 1847. He was educated first,
at Hanwell College, and subsequently at Bonn.</p>

<p>In 1874 Mr. Sims joined the staff of <cite>Fun</cite>,
and about the same time he also became connected
with the <cite>Weekly Dispatch</cite>, to which he
communicated the humorous papers, entitled:
“<cite>Mary Jane’s Memoirs</cite>.”</p>

<p>Since 1877 he has written much in <cite>The
Referee</cite>, over the pseudonym of “Dagonet,” and
most of his Ballads, which have now a worldwide
fame, first appeared in the <a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>columns of
that journal.</p>

<p>As a dramatic author Mr. Sims has also
been both prolific and successful. “Crutch
and Toothpick,” “Mother-in-Law,” “The
Member for Slocum,” “The Gay City,” “The
Half-Way House,” “The Lights o’ London,”
“The Romany Rye,” and “The Merry
Duchess,” are titles well-known to every
modern play-goer.</p>

<p>Judging by the vast amount of work in
essays, dramas, and poems, produced by Mr.
Sims, he must be possessed of extraordinary
energy, powerful imagination, and of rapid
composition. Some of his prose articles and
ballads display an intimate knowledge of the
inner life of the miserable, and the poor of
London, such as could only have been acquired
by one having keen powers of observation,
after considerable time spent in the haunts of
dirt, danger, and disease.</p>

<p>In short, since Dickens left us, no writer has
been so successful in this difficult and trying
branch of literature, and Dickens himself was
never so popular, nor were his works so widely
read by the <em>people</em> as are those of Mr. Sims.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Although there is much that is both droll and humorous in
his prose writings, the principal feature in his Ballads is
homely pathos, of which the following poem is one of the
best known examples.</p>

<p>It is one of the <cite>Ballads of Babylon</cite> (London. John P.
Fuller, 1880), and is given by Mr. Sims’s kind <span class="lock">permission:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">I stood at eve, as the sun went down, by a grave where a woman lies,</div>
<div class="i1">Who lured men’s souls to the shores of sin with the light of her wanton eyes,</div>

<div class="i1">Whose face was as fair as a summer day, and whose heart was as black as night.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yet a blossom I fain would pluck to-day from the garden above her dust;</div>
<div class="i1">Not the languorous lily of soulless sin nor the blood-red rose of lust;</div>

<div class="i1">In the arid desert of Phryne’s life, where all was parched and hot.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">In the summer, when the meadows were aglow with blue and red,</div>
<div class="i1">Joe, the ostler of the Magpie, and fair Annie Smith were wed.</div>
<div class="i1">Plump was Annie, plump and pretty, with a cheek as white as snow;</div>
<div class="i1">He was anything but handsome was the Magpie’s ostler, Joe.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But he won the winsome lassie. They’d a cottage and a cow,</div>
<div class="i1">And her matronhood sat lightly on the village beauty’s brow.</div>
<div class="i1">Sped the months and came a baby&mdash;such a blue-eyed baby boy!</div>
<div class="i1">Joe was working in the stables when they told him of his joy.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He was rubbing down the horses, and he gave them then and there</div>
<div class="i1">All a special feed of clover, just in honour of the heir:</div>
<div class="i1">It had been his great ambition, and he told the horses so,</div>
<div class="i1">That the Fates would send a baby who might bear the name of Joe.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Little Joe the child was christened, and, like babies, grew apace;</div>
<div class="i1">He’d his mother’s eyes of azure and his father’s honest face.</div>
<div class="i1">Swift the happy years went over, years of blue and cloudless sky;</div>
<div class="i1">Love was lord of that small cottage, and the tempests passed them by.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Passed them by for years, then swiftly burst in fury o’er their home.</div>
<div class="i1">Down the lane by Annie’s cottage chanced a gentleman to roam;</div>
<div class="i1">Thrice he came and saw her sitting by the window with her child,</div>
<div class="i1">And he nodded to the baby, and the baby laughed and smiled.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So at last it grew to know him&mdash;little Joe was nearly four;</div>
<span class="pageno">36</span>
<div class="i1">He would call the “pretty gemplun” as he passed the open door;</div>
<div class="i1">And one day he ran and caught him, and in child’s play pulled him in,</div>
<div class="i1">And the baby Joe had prayed for brought about the mother’s sin.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Twas the same old wretched story that for ages bards have sung:</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas a woman weak and wanton and a villain’s tempting tongue;</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas a picture deftly painted for a silly creature’s eyes</div>
<div class="i1">Of the Babylonian wonders and the joy that in them lies.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Annie listened and was tempted; she was tempted and she fell,</div>
<div class="i1">As the angels fell from heaven to the blackest depths of hell;</div>
<div class="i1">She was promised wealth and splendour and a life of guilty sloth,</div>
<div class="i1">Yellow gold for child and husband,&mdash;and the woman left them both.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Home one eve came Joe the Ostler with a cheery cry of “Wife!”</div>
<div class="i1">Finding that which blurred for ever all the story of his life</div>
<div class="i1">She had left a silly letter,&mdash;through the cruel scrawl he spelt;</div>
<div class="i1">Then he sought the lonely bed-room, joined his horny hands and knelt.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Now, O Lord, O God, forgive her, for she ain’t to blame!” he cried;</div>
<div class="i1">“For I owt t’a seen her trouble, and ’a gone away and died.</div>
<div class="i1">Why, a wench like her&mdash;God bless her!&mdash;’twasn’t likely as her’d rest</div>

<div class="i1">Ne’er a bitter word he uttered, but in silence kissed the rod,</div>
<div class="i1">Saving what he told his horses, saving what he told his God.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Far away in mighty London rose the woman into fame,</div>
<div class="i1">For her beauty won men’s homage, and she prospered in her shame;</div>
<div class="i1">Quick from lord to lord she flitted, higher still each prize she won,</div>
<div class="i1">And her rivals paled beside her, as the stars beside the sun.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Next she made the stage her market, and she dragged Art’s temple down</div>
<div class="i1">To the level of a show place for the outcasts of the town.</div>
<div class="i1">And the kisses she had given to poor Ostler Joe for nought</div>
<div class="i1">With their gold and costly jewels rich and titled lovers bought.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Went the years with flying footsteps while her star was at its height;</div>
<div class="i1">Then the darkness came on swiftly, and the gloaming turned to night.</div>
<div class="i1">Shattered strength and faded beauty tore the laurels from her brow;</div>
<div class="i1">Of the thousands who had worshipped never one came near her now.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Broken down in health and fortune, men forgot her very name,</div>
<div class="i1">Till the news that she was dying woke the echoes of her fame;</div>
<div class="i1">And the papers in their gossip mentioned how an “actress” lay</div>
<div class="i1">Sick to death in humble lodgings, growing weaker every day.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One there was who read the story in a far-off country place,</div>
<div class="i1">And that night the dying woman woke and looked upon his face.</div>
<div class="i1">Once again the strong arms clasped her that had clasped her long ago,</div>
<div class="i1">And the weary head lay pillowed on the breast of Ostler Joe.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">All the past had he forgotten, all the sorrow and the shame;</div>
<div class="i1">He had found her sick and lonely, and his wife he now could claim.</div>
<div class="i1">Since the grand folks who had known her one and all had slunk away,</div>
<div class="i1">He could clasp his long-lost darling, and no man would say him nay.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In his arms death found her lying, in his arms her spirit fled;</div>
<div class="i1">And his tears came down in torrents, as he knelt beside her dead.</div>
<div class="i1">Never once his love had faltered through her base unhallowed life;</div>
<div class="i1">And the stone above her ashes bears the honoured name of wife.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">That’s the blossom I fain would pluck to-day from the garden above her dust;</div>
<div class="i1">Not the languorous lily of soulless sin nor the blood-red rose of lust;</div>
<div class="i1">But a sweet white blossom of holy love that grew in the one green spot</div>
<div class="i1">In the arid desert of Phryne’s life, where all was parched and hot.</div>

<p>In 1886, Mrs. James Brown Potter recited this poem at
a soirée given in the house of Mr. Secretary Whitney, in
Washington, U.S.A., before a large company of ladies
and gentlemen. During the recital some of the ladies rose
and left the room; the New York papers spitefully remarked
of those ladies who remained to hear the poem to
the end, that, being in evening dress, they were observed
to blush almost down to their waists.</p>

<p>The poem was severely criticised in several of the prudish
American papers, and assigned by some of them to
the pen of A. C. Swinburne, although as unlike his style
as anything could well be.</p>

<p>The controversy that arose created a tremendous
demand for the poem, and many thousands of copies were
sold in a few days, from which however, the author
derived no benefit whatever, owing to the disgraceful state
of the international copyright, or want of copyright.</p>

<p><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
As Mrs. Kendal has recited the poem in public on
several occasions, it may be taken for granted that it contains
nothing indelicate, or objectionable, although the
outcry raised in the States was so great that the principal
newspapers took sides on the question, and debated the
merits of the poem with almost as much heat as a Presidential
Election. One well-known humorist attempted to
ridicule “Ostler Joe” in the following <span class="lock">ballad:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Teamster Jim.</span></div>
<div class="i1">It ain’t jest the story, Parson, to tell in a crowd like this,</div>
<div class="i1">With the virtuous maiden a-frownin’ an’ chidin’ the giggling miss,</div>
<div class="i1">An’ the good old deacon a-noddin’, in time with his patient snores,</div>
<div class="i1">An’ the shocked elect of the Capital, stalkin’ away through the doors.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But then, it’s a story that happened, an’ every word of it’s true,</div>
<div class="i1">An’ sometimes we can’t help talkin’ of the things that we sometimes do.</div>
<div class="i1">An’ though good society coldly shuts its door on to Teamster Jim,</div>
<div class="i1">I’m thinkin’ ther’s lots worse people, that’s better known than him.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I mind the day he was married, an’ I danced at the weddin’ too;</div>
<div class="i1">An’ I kissed the bride, sweet Maggie, daughter of Ben McGrew.</div>
<div class="i1">I mind how they set up housekeepin’ two young, poor, happy fools,</div>
<div class="i1">When Jim’s only stock was a heavy truck an’ four Kaintucky mules.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Well, they lived along contented, with their little joys an’ cares,</div>
<div class="i1">An’ every year a baby came, an’ twice they came in pairs;</div>
<div class="i1">Till the house was full of children, with their shoutin’ and playin’ and squalls,</div>
<div class="i1">An’ their singin’ an’ laughin’ an’ cryin’ made Bedlam within its walls.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">An’ Jim, he seemed to like it, an’ he spent all his evenin’s at home,</div>
<div class="i1">He said it was full of music, an’ light, an’ peace from pit to dome.</div>
<div class="i1">He joined the church, an’ he used to pray that his heart might be kept from sin&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The stumblin’est prayin’&mdash;but heads and hearts used to bow when he’d begin.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So, they lived along in that way, the same from day to day,</div>
<div class="i1">With plenty of time for drivin’ work, an’ a little time for play.</div>
<div class="i1">An’ growin’ around ’em the sweetest girls and the liveliest, manliest boys,</div>
<div class="i1">Till the old gray heads of the two old folks was crowned with the homeliest joys.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Eh? Come to my story? Well, that’s all. They’re livin’ just like I said,</div>
<div class="i1">Only two of the girls is married, an’ one of the boys is dead,</div>
<div class="i1">An’ they’re honest, an’ decent, an’ happy, an’ the very best Christians I know,</div>
<div class="i1">Though I reckon in brilliant comp’ny they’d be voted a leetle slow.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Oh! you’re pressed for time&mdash;excuse you? Sure, I’m sorry I kept you so long;</div>
<div class="i1">Good-bye! Now he looked kind o’ bored like, an’ I reckon that I was wrong</div>
<div class="i1">To tell such a commonplace story, of two such commonplace lives,</div>
<div class="i1">But we can’t all git drunk, an’ gamble, an’ fight, an’ run off with other men’s wives.</div>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="poemtitle">(<cite>Inserted by Mr. Sims’s permission.</cite>)</div>
<div class="i1">Billy’s dead, and gone to glory, so is Billy’s sister Nell:</div>
<div class="i1">There’s a tale I know about them, were I poet I would tell;</div>
<div class="i1">Soft it comes, with perfume laden, like a breath of country air</div>
<div class="i1">Wafted down the filthy alley, bringing fragrant odours there.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In that vile and filthy alley, long ago, one winter’s day,</div>
<div class="i1">Dying quick of want and fever, hapless, patient Billy lay,</div>
<div class="i1">While beside him sat his sister, in the garret’s dismal gloom,</div>
<div class="i1">Cheering with her gentle presence Billy’s pathway to the tomb.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Many a tale of elf and fairy did she tell the dying child,</div>
<div class="i1">Till his eyes lost half their anguish, and his worn, wan features smiled:</div>
<div class="i1">Tales herself had heard hap-hazard, caught amid the Babel roar,</div>
<div class="i1">Lisped about by tiny gossips playing round their mother’s door.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then she felt his wasted fingers tighten feebly as she told</div>
<div class="i1">How beyond this dismal alley lay a land of shining gold,</div>
<div class="i1">Where, when all the pain was over&mdash;where, when all the tears were shed&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">He would be a white-frocked angel, with a gold thing on his head.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then she told some garbled story of a kind-eyed Saviour’s love,</div>
<div class="i1">How He’d built for little children great big playgrounds up above,</div>
<div class="i1">Where they sang and played at hop-scotch, and at horses all the day,</div>
<div class="i1">And where beadles and policemen never frightened them away.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">This was Nell’s idea of Heaven&mdash;just a bit of what she’d heard,</div>
<div class="i1">With a little bit invented and a little bit inferred.</div>
<div class="i1">But her brother lay and listened, and he seemed to understand,</div>
<div class="i1">For he closed his eyes and murmured he could see the Promised Land.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Yes,” he whispered, “I can see it&mdash;I can see it, sister Nell;</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, the children look so happy, and they’re all so strong and well;</div>
<div class="i1">I can see them there with Jesus&mdash;He is playing with them, too!</div>
<div class="i1">Let us run away and join them, if there’s room for me and you.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She was eight, this little maiden, and her life had all been spent</div>
<div class="i1">In the garret and the alley, where they starved to pay the rent;</div>
<div class="i1">Where a drunken father’s curses and a drunken mother’s blows</div>
<div class="i1">Drove her forth into the gutter from the day’s dawn to its close.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But she knew enough, this outcast, just to tell the sinking boy,</div>
<div class="i1">“You must die before you’re able all these blessings to enjoy.</div>
<div class="i1">You must die,” she whispered, “Billy, and I am not even ill;</div>
<div class="i1">But I’ll come to you, dear brother&mdash;yes, I promise that I will.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“You are dying, little brother,&mdash;you are dying, oh, so fast;</div>
<div class="i1">I heard father say to mother that he knew you could’nt last.</div>
<div class="i1">They will put you in a coffin, then you’ll wake and be up there,</div>
<div class="i1">While I’m left alone to suffer in this garret bleak and bare.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Yes, I know it,” answered Billy. “Ah, but, sister, I don’t mind,</div>
<div class="i1">Gentle Jesus will not beat me; He’s not cruel or unkind.</div>
<div class="i1">But I can’t help thinking, Nelly, I should like to take away</div>
<div class="i1">Something, sister, that you gave me, I might look at every day.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“In the summer you remember how the mission took us out</div>
<div class="i1">To a great green lovely meadow, where we played and ran about,</div>
<div class="i1">And the van that took us halted by a sweet bright patch of land,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the fine red blossoms grew, dear, half as big as mother’s hand.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Nell, I asked the good kind teacher what they called such flowers as those,</div>
<div class="i1">And he told me, I remember, that the pretty name was rose.</div>
<div class="i1">I have never seen them since, dear&mdash;how I wish that I had one!</div>
<div class="i1">Just to keep and think of you, Nell, when I’m up beyond the sun.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Not a word said little Nelly; but at night when Billy slept,</div>
<div class="i1">On she flung her scanty garments, and then down the stairs she crept.</div>
<div class="i1">Through the silent streets of London she ran nimbly as a fawn,</div>
<div class="i1">Running on and running ever till the night had changed to dawn.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
<div class="i1">When the foggy sun had risen, and the mist had cleared away,</div>
<div class="i1">All around her, wrapped in snowdrift, there the open country lay.</div>
<div class="i1">She was tired, her limbs were frozen, and the roads had cut her feet,</div>
<div class="i1">But there came no flowery gardens her poor tearful eyes to greet.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She had traced the road by asking&mdash;she had learnt the way to go;</div>
<div class="i1">She had found the famous meadow&mdash;it was wrapt in cruel snow;</div>
<div class="i1">Not a buttercup or daisy, not a single verdant blade</div>
<div class="i1">Showed its head above its prison. Then she knelt her down and prayed.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">With her eyes upcast to heaven, down she sank upon the ground,</div>
<div class="i1">And she prayed to God to tell her where the roses might be found.</div>
<div class="i1">Then the cold blast numbed her senses, and her sight grew strangely dim;</div>
<div class="i1">And a sudden, awful tremor seemed to seize her every limb.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Oh, a rose!” she moaned, “good Jesus&mdash;just a rose to take to Bill!”</div>
<div class="i1">And as she prayed a chariot came thundering down the hill;</div>
<div class="i1">And a lady sat there, toying with a red rose, rare and sweet;</div>
<div class="i1">As she passed she flung it from her, and it fell at Nelly’s feet.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Just a word her lord had spoken caused her ladyship to fret,</div>
<div class="i1">And the rose had been his present, so she flung it in a pet;</div>
<div class="i1">But the poor, half-blinded Nelly, thought it fallen from the skies,</div>
<div class="i1">And she murmured, “Thank you, Jesus!” as she clasped the dainty prize.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</div>
<div class="i1">Lo that night from out the alley did a child’s soul pass away,</div>
<div class="i1">From dirt and sin and misery to where God’s children play.</div>
<div class="i1">Lo that night a wild, fierce snowstorm burst in fury o’er the land,</div>
<div class="i1">And at morn they found Nell frozen, with the red rose in her hand.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Billy’s dead, and gone to glory, so is Billy’s sister Nell;</div>
<div class="i1">I’m bold to say this happened in the land where angels dwell:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That the children met in heaven, after all their earthly woes,</div>
<div class="i1">And that Nelly kissed her brother, and said, “Billy here’s your rose.”</div>

<div class="i1">Listen to a <em>striking</em> story. Billy and his sister Nell</div>
<div class="i1">Were a pair of gutter youngsters, in an alley had to dwell</div>
<div class="i1">(I am not a noted poet, but to tell you I shall try,</div>
<div class="i1">Since it “comes with perfume laden”&mdash;as a moral&mdash;that is why.)</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Simple toys had made them happy through a sultry summer day</div>
<div class="i1">(Two old boots and one dead kitten), then they quarrelled in their play,</div>
<div class="i1">’Mid the grime on Billy’s visage shone in streaks the angry red,</div>
<div class="i1">And he seized a handy brickbat, which he threw at Nellie’s head.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Little boys should love their sisters&mdash;here I might have had to paint</div>
<div class="i1">How the pretty, hapless maiden suddenly grew pale and faint;</div>
<div class="i1">How anon she drooped and faded, looking dove-like all the while,</div>
<div class="i1">Rending Billy’s little bosom with the sweetness of her smile!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But she didn’t. Nellie started&mdash;darted up each creaking stair</div>
<div class="i1">Till she reached their dismal garret, for she knew a stick was there;</div>
<div class="i1">This she held behind her slyly, meaning to avenge her woes,</div>
<div class="i1">Sought the unsuspecting Billy, and she hit him on the nose.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Billy’s missile missed its object, Nellie’s stick descended hard,</div>
<div class="i1">And the boy from all his pleasures was for three whole weeks debarred;</div>
<div class="i1">Could he hop-scotch in the alley&mdash;in the gutter take his place,</div>
<div class="i1">With that lattice work of plaster&mdash;very dirty&mdash;on his face?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Little boys should love their sisters&mdash;that’s the moral that I meant,</div>
<div class="i1">Seeing Billy’s nasal feature now, alas! is sadly bent;</div>
<div class="i1">And he has a secret sorrow, for whene’er his temper glows,</div>
<div class="i1">Nellie stands with lean arms folded, saying “Billy, how’s your nose?”</div>

<div class="i1">And then we rested and turned, and homeward again we faced,</div>
<div class="i1">When one machine collapsed, sir, as down a hill we raced!</div>
<div class="i1">That was an awful moment, and the stoutest held his breath,</div>
<div class="i1">And watched the wreck on the road, sir, as if he looked on death.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The road was strewn with pieces, and, to tell you the truth, sir, then</div>
<div class="i1">I thought of the Bank in London I never might see again.</div>
<div class="i1">I thought of the manager’s look, sir, if vacant my seat were seen</div>
<div class="i1">On the morrow when I was due there&mdash;and all through a friend’s machine!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">However, I thought I’d risk it; I couldn’t desert a friend,</div>
<div class="i1">So we set to work with a will, sir, the broken wheel to mend,</div>
<div class="i1">And after some skilful hammering our joy can well be guessed</div>
<div class="i1">When we saw the wheel go round again, though shaky at the best.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Well, we stopped at a neighbouring “public”&mdash;of the rest I know no more;</div>
<div class="i1">But I spent next day at the Bank, sir, with limbs both tired and sore,</div>
<div class="i1">And as I sat calm and quiet my memory clouded grew</div>
<div class="i1">As I thought of that awful journey, that ride I had just gone through.</div>

<div class="i1">Such ignorance it do excite a feller-creature’s scorn.</div>
<div class="i1">The Rents is down the Dials way&mdash;a proper kind o’ lair,</div>
<div class="i1">Where happy dossers come each night, and doss upon the stair.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I’ve done it many times and oft;&mdash;but never mind ’bout me,</div>
<div class="i1">It’s of Bill Basher I would jaw this arternoon, d’ye see?</div>
<div class="i1">The “Terror o’ the Rents” he was, and well deserved the name,</div>
<div class="i1">And yet, I hold, his heart was soft and tender all the same.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He couldn’t bear no cant, poor Bill, and humbug driv him wild,</div>
<div class="i1">They made a savage of a chap as was by nature mild;</div>
<div class="i1">And so it came to pass as he would always have his knife</div>
<div class="i1">Into a cove as paid his way and lived a decent life.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Joe Tomkins, he was one o’ these&mdash;a mean and sneaking cuss,</div>

<div class="i1">“Let’s have a wet,” said Bill one day. Said Joseph, “Not for Joe!”</div>
<div class="i1">No wonder Bill was riled at that&mdash;he would be, don’t you know.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So later on, when he’d got screwed, he made for Joseph’s room,</div>
<div class="i1">As sat at tea, all unprepared to meet his orful doom.</div>
<div class="i1">Bill landed him upon the nose a wunner, so he did,</div>
<div class="i1">And then perceeded for to kick Joe’s missis and his kid.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He jumped upon the three of them, and then he come away&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">You can’t see where his heart was soft, I think I heard you say.</div>
<div class="i1">Hold on; don’t take a feller up so precious sharp as that&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1"><em>Bill came away and didn’t hurt the Tomkins’ tabby cat</em>.</div>

<div class="i1">I see that animile last week, a-looking sleek and well,</div>
<div class="i1">But Bill he’s picking of his hemp inside a prison cell.</div>

<div class="i1">“If you rob a pore man of his lotion,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A hero has spoken, as valiant</div>
<div class="i2">A fellow as ever broke bread&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">As fly as a cop. He could hammer a slop,</div>

<div class="i2"><span class="sc">And the unclosed Davy Lamp</span>!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A flash and a terrible rumbling,</div>

<div class="i1">A word from the junction signals,</div>

<div class="i1">I’ve hardly a second for thought, sir,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">A window opens above us,</div>

<div class="i1">A ladder is put to the window,</div>
<div class="i2">A young fellow pulls off his hat,</div>

<div class="i1"><span class="sc">We sweep like a wave past the Red Post!</span></div>
<div class="i2">It’s now that the battle begins.</div>

<div class="i1">It was a ballad monger,</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">Little Flo.’</span></div>
<div class="i1">Tell you the tale o’ Flo, sir, and how she came to die?</div>
<div class="i1">’Twere a sad time in my life, tho’ it’s so long gone by.</div>
<div class="i1">I was a drunken brute then&mdash;never thought much o’ Flo;</div>
<div class="i1">Nearly al’ays in liquor&mdash;got jolly screwed, you know.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yes, I treated her shockin’! life must ha’ been pretty bad,</div>
<div class="i1">She’d prom’sed her dyin’ mother al’ays to look after dad.</div>
<div class="i1">I used to laugh at her notions, she was but a gal o’ seven,</div>
<div class="i1">And ’ad got it fixed in her ’ead to bring me along to heaven.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Dad!” she’d say to me sometimes, “it’s beau’ful bright in there;</div>
<div class="i1">Everyone’s al’ays ’appy, and got golden crowns to wear.”</div>
<div class="i1">How I laughed at the child then, to think o’ a crown on my head;</div>
<div class="i1">I told her to shut up cantin’, I didn’t want to be dead.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Still some’ow I wasn’t ’appy, for ’appen I’d got a fright,</div>
<div class="i1">And wondered whatever’ud’appen if I should die that night,</div>
<div class="i1">So to keep down her pleadin’s I off on a pretty good spree,</div>
<div class="i1">Down at the pub at the corner, along o’ my mates and me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">We was pretty gone on the wrong side, stagg’rin’ ’ome that night,</div>
<div class="i1">And there was Flo sittin’ and watchin’, with the room clean and bright.</div>
<div class="i1">With a curse at her for waitin’ I flung myself on the bed,</div>
<div class="i1">Catchin’ the lamp with my arm, and pullin’ it down on my ’ead.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Flo flung herself down upon me, and then I woke from my daze,</div>
<div class="i1">We smoth’rd the flames with a rug, but Flo was all a blaze.</div>
<div class="i1">I flung the blanket upon her, I seemed to go off my ’ead;</div>
<div class="i1">But when I got back to my senses, they told me that Flo was dead.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
<div class="i1">She’d given her life for her father, for such a wretch as me,</div>
<div class="i1">And mainly because she knew, sir, that I warn’t fit to die.</div>
<div class="i1">When I got better they told me the last words ’o little Flo</div>
<div class="i1">“They wouldn’t have ’im in ’eaven, if he was drunk, you know.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">On my word, sir, that fetched me, I never drank since that night;</div>
<div class="i1">And I prays as I’ll follow Flo up to her ’ome ’o light.</div>
<div class="i1">For as that child forgave me, I believes by and by</div>
<div class="i1">As He’ll forgive me too, sir, who came for sinners to die.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So little Flo’s life warn’t lost, she showed me the way to live;</div>
<div class="i1">She showed me what goodness meant, the way that a girl can forgive.</div>
<div class="i1">When I am tempted to drink, I thinks o’ the last words o’ Flo,</div>

The pathetic ballads of Mr. Sims are frequently chosen
for recitation, and good parodies of them are much sought
after, as a relief to the overwrought feelings of the
auditors.</p>

<p>There is a recitation written by Mr. Richard H. Douglass,
which is often given by him with success, entitled
“Christmas Day in the Beer-house.”</p>

<p>In its opening lines it somewhat resembles Mr. Sims’s
“Christmas Day in the Workhouse,” but it does not
follow that poem sufficiently to be styled a parody, and is,
moreover, rather coarse in its style.</p>

<p>Every one remembers “The Manual for Young Reciters,”
which appeared in <cite>Punch</cite> in 1887, and has since
been issued in a small volume, entitled “Burglar Bill,”
by J. Anstey, (London, Bradbury, Agnew &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>) Two
of the papers contained in this are imitations of Mr. Sims;
<cite>Burglar Bill</cite> is one, but a far more amusing specimen is
<cite>A Coster’s Conversion</cite>. A poor harmless costermonger
relates how he</p>

<h3 class="h3head ls">CLEMENT W. SCOTT.</h3>

<p>Many poems written by this distinguished dramatic
critic are chosen for recitation, notably “The Women of
Mumbles Head” which is to be found in “<cite>Lays of a
Londoner</cite>” (London, Carson and Comerford, 1886.) A
very funny parody of this, entitled “The Wreck of the
Steamship ‘Puffin,’” is in <cite>Burglar Bill</cite>, by J. Anstey,
and would form an amusing contrast to the original, in
the second part of an entertainment.</p>

<p>Another well-known poem by Mr. Clement Scott was
the <cite>Tale of the Tenth Hussars</cite>, in favour of the late Colonel
Valentine Baker, which originally appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>, and
was quoted, with a parody on it, on <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 87, <abbr title="volume four">vol. iv.</abbr> <cite>Parodies</cite>.</p>

<h3 class="h3head ls">ROBERT BROWNING.</h3>

<p>In dealing with Parodies of the works of living
authors, the chief difficulty to contend with is, that
some of the parodies may read rather flat and uninteresting
to those who are unacquainted with the
original poem.</p>

<p>Such familiar poems as Lord Tennyson’s “May
Queen,” or “Lady Clara Vere-de-Vere,” it would
of course be quite unnecessary to reprint, but now
that more modern poems are under consideration
it is desirable to give such of the originals as can
be inserted, with the authors’ express permission.
Hitherto the necessary authority has been gracefully
accorded, and, in several instances, supplemented
by valuable bibliographical information.
Thus showing that some of the leading poets of
the day recognise the value of this Collection as a
literary record, and fully appreciate the strict line
that is drawn to exclude vulgar, personal, or malicious
lampoons.</p>

<p>In accordance therefore with the usual custom,
a courteously worded letter was sent to Mr. Robert
Browning, asking his permission to quote a few
extracts from his shorter poems, with the assurance
that no offensive parody of his works should be
inserted.</p>

<p>Mr. Browning’s reply was to the effect that as
he disapproved of every kind of Parody he refused
permission to quote any of his poems, adding in
somewhat ungracious language, that his publishers
would be instructed to see that his wishes were
complied with.</p>

<p>Perhaps the world does not greatly care whether
Mr. Browning approves of Parody, or does not;
neither can he very well expect that the completeness
of this Collection should be sacrificed in deference
to his distaste for a harmless branch of literature
which has amused many of our greatest
authors, and best of men. Byron and Scott could
laugh at the <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>, and enjoy a merry
jest, even at their own expense, but let no dog
bark when the great Sir Oracle opens his lips, and
no daring humourist venture to travesty the poems
of Mr. Robert Browning!</p>

<p>This injunction comes rather late, for numerous
parodies of his works have already been written,
of which some of the best must be included here.
It is to be hoped that the perusal of them may induce
some readers to seek in the originals those
beauties which herein are only dimly shadowed
forth.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Browning was born at Camberwell
in 1812, and educated at the London University.
In September 1846, he married Miss Elizabeth
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
Barrett, the poetess (who died in 1861), by whom
he had one son, Mr. Robert Browning, the well-known
artist.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD
NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX.</p>

<p>This is probably the best known of Mr. Browning’s
earlier poems, it is given in <cite>Bell’s Standard Elocutionist</cite>, and
various other collections.</p>

<p>On January 23, 1882, Mr. Browning wrote to the <span class="lock"><cite>Oracle</cite>&mdash;</span>“There
is no sort of historical foundation for the poem
about ‘Good News from Ghent.’ I wrote it under the
bulwark of a vessel, off the African coast, after I had been
at sea long enough to appreciate even the fancy of a gallop
on the back of a certain good horse, ‘York,’ then in my
stable at home.</p>

<p>“It was written in pencil on the fly-leaf of Bartolio’s
‘Simboli,’ I remember.”</p>

<p>This Poem was chosen as the original for a Parody
Competition in <cite>The World</cite>, and the two following parodies
appeared in that entertaining journal on August 13, 1879.</p>

<div class="i1">One turn in the saddle to look at the smoke,</div>
<div class="i1">Then into a canter the stout pony broke.</div>
<div class="i1">“All right!” cried the laager’s last picket; and I,</div>
<div class="i1">“Right!” cheerily answered, as, cantering by,</div>

<div class="i1">Each strap was in place, each buckle was right,</div>

<div class="i1">I started at noon, and at Panda’s old kraal</div>
<div class="i1">We stayed, where there tinkled a thin waterfall,</div>

<div class="i1">With my hand on the pommel, then into the selle&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The stouter the pair of us, so for the rest&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">We swished through the grass to the crimsoning west.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">By the river, and up through the pass in the range;</div>
<div class="i1">By track of the troops and trail that was strange</div>
<div class="i1">Down donga and drift, past koppie and stone,</div>
<div class="i1">We galloped while daylight should last all alone.</div>

<div class="i1">I groomed his hot legs with the African herb</div>
<div class="i1">And he snuffled responsive and rattled his curb.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then a thick fog crawled to us and shut up the moon,</div>
<div class="i1">And the stars too; nor did I a minute too soon,</div>
<div class="i1">With compass and chart, once more strike the trail,</div>
<div class="i1">And shake the staunch pony together to sail&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Like a stout ship, keen watch at the bows, and steered small</div>
<div class="i1">Mid berg and mid mist&mdash;to a guessed-at landfall.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Well, we fetched it at last; nor did I refuse</div>
<div class="i1">A draught of good wine in return for my news.</div>
<div class="i1">The battle was fought, and the tidings were brought</div>
<div class="i1">By a man and a horse, thirty leagues at a bout.</div>

<div class="i1">On, on still I rode, as the wild huntsman rides:</div>

<div class="i1">Feel the shudder that shook him as wind shakes the trees;</div>
<div class="i1">Yet onward he struggled with fast-failing strength,</div>
<div class="i1">And safe into Landsman’s Drift galloped at length.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And all I remembered was, “Now it is done;</div>

<div class="i1">I steadied each muscle and braced up my nerve,</div>

<div class="i1">We were scratch all at starting; but when we drew near</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">At five miles I spurted and kept up the run,</div>

<div class="i1">My sturdy opponents and left them at last,</div>
<div class="i1">With sure-footed pedals each spinning away,</div>
<div class="i1">And still on the watch like a cat for its prey.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I now kept the inside and heard them at my back&mdash;</div>

<div class="i1">And each eye’s sharp look-out lest they neared on the right,</div>
<div class="i1">Kept my bi. well in hand as each wheel came in sight;</div>
<div class="i1">And the roar of the people which aye and anon</div>

<div class="i1">“Poor fellow, fought bravely, the fault’s not in him,</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis cursed ill-luck!” For he saw by his face,</div>
<div class="i1">Scarred and cut, and white lips, he was out of the race,</div>
<div class="i1">And carried him off to the shade of the tent</div>
<div class="i1">And came back to criticise us as we went.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So we were left treadling, Wheeler and I,</div>

<div class="i1">The broad sun above shed its pitiless shine,</div>
<div class="i1">Down my face rolled the sweat and stung me like brine;</div>

<div class="i1">Said, “Go it, my hearties, this lap is the last!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">How they shouted! and all in a moment a spurt</div>

<div class="i1">He and I fought the battle, and onlooked the rest,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then I called up my energies; loud was the cry</div>
<div class="i1">That came from the thousands of spectators nigh;</div>
<div class="i1">Gripped firmly the handles, the grasp of grim death,</div>

<p class="p2 center ls">THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.</p>

<p>This poem is given in full in <cite>The Comic Poets of the
Nineteenth Century</cite>, published by Routledge &amp; Sons,
London. It has been the subject of several political
parodies, one of the best being that which appeared in
Punch, May 1, 1880, entitled “The Bagpiper of Midlothian.”
This described how the Liberals in Midlothian
despaired of their cause, and the Tories were jubilant,
when suddenly <cite>Wandering Willie</cite> the Piper appeared.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">And “Please your Worships,” said he, “I’m able,</div>
<div class="i1">By means of a secret charm, to draw</div>
<div class="i1">All creatures&mdash;with ears&mdash;beneath the sun;</div>
<div class="i1">After me they are bound to run</div>
<div class="i1">In such a style as you never saw.</div>
<div class="i1">I’m willing,” said he, “to try my charm</div>
<div class="i1">On the Tories&mdash;they’re doing the country harm.</div>
<div class="i1">I’m also possessed of a spell, you’ll see,</div>
<div class="i1">To strengthen limp Libs, who’ve gone weak at the knee;</div>
<div class="i1">The time-serving Rat and the envious Viper;</div>
<div class="i1">And they call me Wandering <span class="sc">Willie</span> the Piper.”</div>
<div class="i1">And here they observed that he carried his pipes,</div>
<div class="i1">This man of the breeze-blown Galashiels stripes,</div>
<div class="i1">And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying,</div>
<div class="i1">As if impatient to be playing.</div>
<div class="i1">But the Big-Whigs looked just a little bit cool,</div>
<div class="i1">Inclined to believe that the man was a fool;</div>
<div class="i1">Whilst the Tories yelled “You may do your worst,</div>
<div class="i1">And blow away till your Bagpipes burst.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Into the street the Piper stept,</div>
<div class="i5">Smiling a little sardonic smile,</div>
<div class="i4">Gs if he knew what music slept,</div>
<div class="i5">In his quiet pipes the while.</div>
<div class="i1">Then like a regular Scotch adept,</div>
<div class="i1">To blow the pipes his lips he bagged,</div>
<div class="i1">His fingers flew, ne’er a moment they lagged,</div>
<div class="i1">And e’er three notes the pipes had uttered</div>
<div class="i1">You heard as if all Scotland muttered;</div>
<div class="i1">And the muttering grew to a mighty roaring,</div>
<div class="i1">And out of their strongholds the Tories came pouring,</div>
<div class="i1">With many a grunt and many a groan:</div>
<div class="i1">And not the Tory hosts alone,</div>
<div class="i1">But the Liberal rats. There were swell rats, seedy rats,</div>
<div class="i1">Bold rats, timid rats, plump rats, greedy rats,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor the rats and the Tories alone came forth,</div>
<div class="i1">But the long-silent Radical hosts of the North,</div>
<div class="i1">Willingly, gleefully, shouting and cheering,</div>
<div class="i1">Heedless of “fagots,” of jibe, and of jeering,</div>
<div class="i1">Grave old plodders, and gay young friskers,</div>
<div class="i2">Grandfathers, fathers, sons, uncles, and cousins;</div>
<div class="i1">Greybeards, boys with scarce-budding whiskers,</div>
<div class="i2">Valiant voters, by twos, tens, dozens.</div>
<div class="i1">And as still that Piper (a plague on him!) played.</div>
<div class="i1">Not the North alone in his train was arrayed,</div>
<div class="i1">But the Voters flocked from east, west, south,</div>
<div class="i1">And the Midlands, witched by that magical mouth;</div>
<div class="i1">Voters from counties, and cities, and boroughs,</div>
<div class="i1">From toil at the furnace, from work at the furrows;</div>
<div class="i1">Voters from mansion, mart, meadow, and mine,</div>
<div class="i1">Voters of all sorts and sizes, in fine,</div>
<div class="i1">Rushing and crushing, ran eagerly after</div>
<div class="i1">That wonderful music, with shouting and laughter.</div>
<div class="i1">Then the Big-Whigs stared, and the Tories stood</div>
<div class="i1">As if they were changed into blocks of wood,</div>
<div class="i1">Unable to fashion a fetching cry</div>
<div class="i1">To rally those Voters hurrying by&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Could only follow with envious eye,</div>
<div class="i1">Hearts in the doldrums and heads on the rack,</div>
<div class="i1">That numberless crowd at the Piper’s back,</div>
<div class="i1">A mighty flood whose resistless roll</div>
<div class="i1">Swept that Piper’s foes from their place at the Poll.</div>

<div class="i1">But consume night’s oil instead.</div>

<div class="i1">Yet I noticed, like a flowering shrub</div>
<div class="i2">A bloom in a desert, one striking grace:</div>
<div class="i1">They might “screw” like mad when afloat in a “tub,”</div>
<div class="i2">And never get up the ghost of a pace,</div>
<div class="i1">But they had a “<span class="sc">Browning</span> Club”!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So, when one waxed ill, it did not seem strange</div>
<div class="i2">That the Lady Principal sighed, and said,</div>
<div class="i1">“A stoppage of work I must arrange;</div>
<div class="i2">To studies recondite she’s too much wed,</div>
<div class="i1">And from books she needs a change.”</div>

<div class="i2">And the mystic masterly fruit of his brains</div>
<div class="i1">Is my solace, glory, and pride!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Her request being granted, asleep fell she;</div>
<div class="i2">The Lady Principal joyed at that;</div>
<div class="i1">But when the Doctor dropped in, said he,</div>
<div class="i2">“It’s only a bilious attack, that’s flat.</div>
<div class="i1">Brain trouble? Fiddle-de-dee!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The desk, it chanced, was not quite closed:</div>
<div class="i2">“Why does she clutch it so?” asked the leech;</div>
<div class="i1">The Lady Principal supposed</div>
<div class="i2">That to have her dear Bard within reach</div>
<div class="i1">Consoled her as she dozed.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Let’s look inside!” And at once&mdash;oh, dreams</div>
<div class="i2">Of “Female Culture,” and the rest!</div>
<div class="i1">They found&mdash;no masterly mystic themes,</div>

<p>Of Mr. Browning’s later poetry, or, what
may be termed his involved and complicated
style, some excellent parodies exist. They are
rather long, and would be somewhat tedious
reading to those who are unfamiliar with the
originals; as the books in which most of these
parodies occur are easily obtainable a few
extracts will suffice.</p>

<p>First, may be mentioned <cite>Diversions of the Echo Club</cite>, an
American work written by the late Mr. Bayard Taylor, published,
in London, by Chatto and Windus.</p>

<p>This contains no less than four imitations of Robert
Browning’s poetry, they are all good, but perhaps the
following is the most characteristic in <span class="lock">style:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>From <cite>Fly Leaves</cite>, by C. S. Calverley. London. George
Bell &amp; Sons.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In <cite>The Heptalogia</cite> (Chatto and Windus, 1880) there is an
imitation of Browning, entitled “John Jones,” and in
<cite>Recaptured Rhymes</cite>, by H. D. Traill (W. Blackwood and
Sons, 1882) there is a parody from “The Puss and the
Boots.” These cannot be quoted in full, and extracts
would convey little idea of the humour of the pieces. The
latter (by Mr. Traill) is modelled somewhat upon Mr.
Calverley’s “Cock and the Bull.”</p>

<p>In July 1888, <cite>The Family Herald</cite> (London) had a long
article on parodies, which contained some amusing examples,
but the writer of the article committed the unpardonable
literary crime of not giving references to the authorities
from whom he quoted. His note on Robert Browning’s
poetry, and his parodies, is given <span class="lock">below:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Browning is far too great a man to be mentioned
lightly; but we must own that to some natures his later
work is distasteful, and even repulsive. His early poetry
ranks among the highest in English; and, if we were compelled
to write down the names of, say, six poems which we
regard as the best in the language, two of the six&mdash;“The
Last Ride Together” and “The Flight of the Duchess”&mdash;would
be Mr. Browning’s. Perhaps he is too great now
to be content with mere brilliant work that haunts the
memory for life, and inspires the innermost soul. If so, we
are sorry, for we would not give the two poems which we
have named, with perhaps the “Ride from Ghent to Aix,”
for a library of exasperating <cite>Sordellos</cite>. We cannot cure Mr.
Browning, and we must be content to endure him for the
sake of old times. The great, crabbed, formless poet gives
the buffoons a rare innings; for his jagged, ramshackle blank
verse, with its conjunctions protruding at the ends of lines,
its parentheses, its small jokes, its puns, its pedantic display
of useless learning, its aimless wanderings, its half-hints,
all tend to make the reader feel as if he were taking a little
walk with a halting cripple who persisted in digging him in
the ribs, and kicking up dust before his eyes. When we get
a gleam of lucidity from Browning, he is matchless; but he
refuses to write plain English and so the parodists have him
on the hip. Here is a parody by a skilled craftsman who
handles the poet with <span class="lock">affection&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="unindent">The strange thing is that the rickety stuff above is a perfectly
fair burlesque. The cadence&mdash;or lack of cadence&mdash;the
horrid involutions, the breaks into bald dulness, are all
Browning’s to the very essence.”</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This is not the place in which to enter upon a dissertation
on the style of Mr. Robert Browning. Profundity of thought
is not necessarily accompanied by obscurity of language, and
yet the admirers of Mr. Browning contend that it is precisely
in those poems which are the most difficult to understand,
that his chief excellencies are to be found. Hence several
“Browning Societies” have been started for the express
purpose of explaining this obscure writer to persons of only
<em>average</em> intelligence. Now a Homer society, or a Shakespeare
society, one can understand, these poets are dead and
cannot be appealed to, for the solution of doubtful readings,
or confused passages. But Mr. Browning is alive and well,
and should be able, if he were willing, to clear up the meaning
of any obscurity in his own writings. Were he to do
this, however, a few amiable hero-worshippers, and fussy
founders of Societies, would lose their vocation, and perhaps
the public would not greatly gain.</p>

<p>Many anecdotes are told of Browning’s obscurity.</p>

<p>When Douglas Jerrold was recovering from a severe
illness, Browning’s “Sordello” was put into his hands.
Line after line, page after page, he read; but no consecutive
idea could he get from the mystic production. Mrs. Jerrold
was out, and he had no one to whom to appeal. The
thought struck him that he had lost his reason during his
illness, and that he was so imbecile that he did not know it.
A perspiration burst from his brow, and he sat silent and
thoughtful. As soon as his wife returned he thrust the
mysterious volume into her hands, crying out: “Read this,
my dear.” After several attempts to make any sense out of
the first page or so, she gave back the book, saying:
“Bother the gibberish! I don’t understand a word of it!”
“Thank heaven!” cried Jerrold, “then I am not an idiot!”</p>

<p>A long haired man, with a look of unutterable yearning in
his deep set eyes, stole into the well filled auditorium, and
took a seat in the rear pew. He listened to the speaker with
the closest attention, and seemed to derive the most intense
enjoyment from words which were incomprehensible to the
majority of the audience.</p>

<p>“Magnificent! sublime!” he was heard to murmur.</p>

<p><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
“You understand him, sir?” inquired the man next the
long haired stranger.</p>

<p>“Perfectly, perfectly. Did you ever hear anything
more”&mdash;</p>

<p>“But I can’t understand a word he says.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! You are to be pitied. Ah, this seems like
home. You see, I arrived from New York only an hour ago,
and happening to hear of this meeting came here at once.”</p>

<p>“It is not possible that you are a Chinaman?”</p>

<p>“A Chinaman! What do you mean, Sir? I am from
Boston.”</p>

<p>“From Boston, eh? How is it that you understand
Chinese?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand Chinese, sir. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, the man who is speaking is a missionary who has
just returned from Hong Kong, and he is exhibiting his proficiency
in the Chinese language by reading a chapter in the
Bible in that tongue.”</p>

<p>The Bostonian’s face paled.</p>

<p>“Why,” he gasped, “isn’t this a Browning Club?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“And isn’t he reading one of the great master’s”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Great Scott, no! The Browning club is on the next
floor.”</p>

hopeless, despairing look in his fathomless orbs.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Frederick Locker-Lampson.</h3>

<p>The refinement of taste which has marked
the second half of the nineteenth century has
been highly favourable to the production of the
lighter forms of poetry, and no other age has
been so prolific in writers of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers-de-société</i> and
of those other more exotic forms of composition
known as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ballades</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rondeaus</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villanelles</i>.</p>

<p>It is true that Praed, who led the way as the
writer of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers-de-société</i>, died fifty years ago, but
for one who now reads Praed, there are twenty
who know by heart the poems of Frederick
Locker.</p>

<p>And there can be no hesitation in assigning
him the leading position amongst those of our
living Poets who write to please, and instruct,
by their playful wit, gentle satire, and tender
pathos, without deeming it necessary to
compose sermons in epics, or poems which
require as much labour to disentangle as to
solve a problem of Euclid.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. Frederick Locker, for in that name he achieved fame,
was born in 1821, coming of an old and distinguished
Kentish family. His father was a Civil Commissioner of
Greenwich Hospital, and his grandfather was the Captain
W. Locker, R. N., under whom both Lord Nelson and
Lord Collingwood served. Lord Nelson attributed much of
his success in battle to the maxim inculcated by his old
commander, “Lay a Frenchman close, and you will beat
him.”</p>

<p>Captain Locker died Lieutenant-Governor of Greenwich
Hospital.</p>

<p>The literary career of Mr. Frederick Locker has been
so uniformly successful that there is little to recount.</p>

<p>His original poems were mostly published in the magazines,
until in 1857 he issued his volume entitled “London
Lyrics.” The first edition, which is now very scarce, and
much sought after by collectors, had a frontispiece by
George Cruikshank. This book has passed through many
editions, and is now published by Kegan Paul, Trench and
Co., London.</p>

<p>In 1867, Mr. Locker published “Lyra Elegantiarum,”
containing a collection of the best English <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers-de-société</i>,
with an introduction in which he enumerated the qualifications
which should be possessed by any poet who aspired to
produce perfect specimens of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers-de-société</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Locker-Lampson has also written a few humorous
parodies, one of which, “Unfortunate Miss Bailey,” was
given <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 47,
<abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I.</abbr>, <cite>Parodies</cite>.</p>

<p>It only remains to be said that in the following pages the
extracts from his poems are inserted by the kind permission
of Mr. Locker-Lampson.</p>

<p>One of his best known poems, “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Street,”
was published in 1867. This was stolen, and spoiled in the

<h3 class="h3head">AUSTIN DOBSON.</h3>

<p>The proverb that “Imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery” is somewhat the worse for wear,
and perhaps Mr. Austin Dobson was not altogether
inclined to agree with it when he heard that the
Puzzle Editor of <cite>Truth</cite> had published the following
notification:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">“Truth” Puzzle, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 472.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Thanks to the efforts of Messrs. Austin Dobson, Andrew
Lang, and others, Triolets, Ballades, Rondeaux, Vilanelles,
and other metrical devices used by Villon and other
French poets of the past, have been freely adapted to
English verse-writing, and I am assured that I shall be
setting numerous competitors an agreeable task in asking
them to write a rhyming composition on one of the revived
French models now so fashionable.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Prize of Two Guineas will accordingly be given for
the <cite>Best Ballade</cite>, written on any Social Subject, in accordance
with the following rules:&mdash;The <cite>Ballade</cite> in its normal
type, consists of three stanzas of eight lines each, followed
by a verse of four lines, which is called the “envoy”&mdash;or
of three verses of ten lines, with an “envoy” of five lines,
each of the stanzas and the “envoy” closing with the
same line, known as the “refrain.” In this instance, a
<cite>Ballade</cite> of the former length is asked for&mdash;viz.; one with
three eight-lined stanzas and a four-lined “envoy.” But
it will be, perhaps, a better guide for competitors if I print
here a <cite>Ballade</cite> as a model on which they are to form the
ones they compose. Here, then, is a well-known <cite>Ballade</cite>
by Mr. Austin Dobson, which must be followed so far as
the arrangement of rhymes goes. The metre, though,
of the <cite>Ballade</cite> often varies, and competitors are not
bound to use the same metre as that employed in the
subjoined specimen.</p>

<p>A very large number of replies were sent in, and examples
were printed in <cite>Truth</cite>, February 23, and March
8, 1888. Although they cannot be called true parodies,
yet two of the <cite>Ballades</cite> are so interesting as imitations
that they are inserted. The first being that to which the

<h3 class="h3head">Ballades, Rondeaus and Villanelles.</h3>

<p>The revival of the taste for these curious old
French forms of poetry has received a great impetus
from the delightful examples produced
by Austin Dobson, Edmund Gosse, W. E.
Henley, Andrew Lang, R. Le Gallienne, J.
Ashby-Sterry, A. C. Swinburne, C. H. Waring
and Oscar Wilde.</p>

<p>The composition of all poetry in the English language is
governed by clearly defined rules, and although a man
ignorant of these rules, if gifted with a fine ear, and original
conceptions, may produce a pretty song or ballad, it is
very rare indeed that any truly great work is composed,
which is not written in accordance with certain regulations
as to metre and rhyme.</p>

<p>In ordinary poetry these restrictions allow of great variations
in style and treatment, but it is far otherwise when any
of the old French poetical fashions are selected; then the
rules are exact and peremptory, and for each of the following
varieties, the form is clearly defined, and perfectly distinct.
They are the <cite>Ballade</cite>, <cite>Chant Royal</cite>, <cite>Kyrielle</cite>, <cite>Pantoum</cite>,
<cite>Rondeau Redoublé</cite>, <cite>Rondel</cite>, <cite>Rondeau</cite>, <cite>Sicilian Octave</cite>, <cite>Triolet</cite>,
and <cite>Villanelle</cite>, with a few minor forms.</p>

<p>It is quite beyond the scope of this collection to formulate
the rules governing the composition of these poetic trifles,
nor indeed is it necessary, for Mr. Gleeson White’s charming
little book on the subject is readily accessible, and contains
nearly all that can be said about it. It is entitled <cite>Ballades
and Rondeaus</cite>, selected, with a chapter on the various forms,
by Gleeson White. London, Walter Scott, 1887.</p>

<p>The editor’s name is sufficient to indicate that the selections
are the best that could be chosen, and the introductory
essay is, in itself, a distinct gain to our literature, treating as
it does, of a somewhat exotic branch of poetry. Mr. Gleeson
White is very much in earnest, and although he inserts a
few burlesques it is evident that he regards them as desecrations
of his favourite metres.</p>

<p>To the Parodist nothing is sacred, but whilst some of the
following parodies are quoted from Mr. White’s collection,
those who would wish to read the originals must refer to the
work itself.</p>

<p>In <cite>Punch</cite> (October 22, 1887) there was a set of verses (in
honour of Mr. White’s book) written in the various metres
described, and one of each of these may fitly lead the several
varieties here dealt with.</p>

<p>In an amusing little collection of poems quite recently
published, there are several parodies and three ballades, all
on legal topics, from which the following extracts are quoted
by the kind permission of Messrs. Reeves and Turner. The
title of the book is <cite>The Lays of a Limb of the Law</cite>, by the
late John Popplestone, Town Clerk of Stourmouth, edited by
Edmund B. V. Christian. London: Reeves and Turner,
1889. It contains Law Reports in the shape of parodies of
Cowper’s “Alexander Selkirk;” of Pope’s translation of
Homer, “The Splendid Shilling,” and of other poems in a
manner somewhat similar to those contained in Professor
Frederick Pollock’s well-known, but scarce little work,
“Leading Cases Done into English.”</p>

<p>Of the three ballades perhaps the following is the <span class="lock">best:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="h3head">Poets of the Æsthetic School</h3>

<p>About ten years ago London Society was divided into
two hostile Camps, one known as the <cite>Æsthetes</cite>, the other
as the <cite>Philistines</cite>. Neither title was correct, nor very expressive,
but each conveyed a certain meaning which even
now could not be briefly expressed in more simple
language.</p>

<p>The <cite>Æsthetes</cite> were originally a small body of artists and
poets, belonging to what was called the Pre-Raphaelite
school, who strove to educate the English people up to a
certain standard in art and culture.</p>

<p>All the men who founded this school subsequently became
eminent in their professions, but they were, for
many years, subjected to the ridicule and criticisms of the
Philistines.</p>

<p>Yet it is probable that most of this opposition was
directed less against the men of genius who actually
created Pre-Raphaelitism, than against those too ardent
devotees of the new fashion, who carried all its dictates to
the extreme, and frequently turned the true and the beautiful
into the absurd and grotesque by their exaggerations
in dress, language, and deportment.</p>

<p>On the other hand many of the opponents of Æstheticism
were those who having seen Du Maurier’s caricatures
in <cite>Punch</cite>, and witnessed Burnand’s vamped up old comedy
<cite>The Colonel</cite>, or Gilbert &amp; Sullivan’s <cite>Patience</cite>, thought
themselves fully qualified to jeer at the “consummate”
the “utter” and the “too-too,” without having either
read a poem by Swinburne, or Morris, or having seen a
painting by Burne-Jones or Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</p>

<p>This opposition did some good in its day, for although
<cite>Æstheticism</cite> eventually triumphed, only the beautiful
that it created has survived, the lank and melancholy
maidens, and the “Grosvenor-Gallery” young men, have
departed, but the revival&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Renaissance</i> in fact&mdash;of
British Art in Painting, poetry, dress, decoration, and
even in house furniture, is an accomplished fact. Much
has been written, and remains to be written, on this
fascinating topic, but this collection cannot be made the
medium for Lectures on Art.</p>

<p>At the risk of appearing egotistical the following little
work can be mentioned as conveying useful information on
a subject which is certainly worthy of some little <span class="lock">study:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<cite>The Æsthetic Movement in England</cite>,” by Walter
Hamilton. Third edition&mdash;London. Reeves and Turner,
1882.</p>

<p>Without further preface a selection of parodies will be
given on the works of Rossetti, who was not only a founder
of the school, but also one of its most eminent exponents.</p>

<p>This, and other poems by Rossetti, such as <cite>Eden Bower</cite>,
and <cite>Troy Town</cite>, only revived a very old fashion&mdash;the ballad
with a refrain or burden.</p>

<p>But when once it <em>was</em> revived so many indifferent poets
attempted to utter their little insipidities in the ballad
style, that the parodists soon caught the infection. One
gentleman furbished up a tremendous ballad which resembled
nothing so much as the cry of a costermonger,
for its burden, oft repeated, <span class="lock">was&mdash;</span></p>

<p>When Mr. Calverley composed this burlesque Ballad
(which is to be found in full in his <cite>Fly Leaves</cite>, published

<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
one by Mr. Morris, entitled “Two Red Roses across the
Moon” commencing “There was a lady liv’d in a hall,”
and ending with the refrain which forms the title.</p>

<p>Having once shown how it could be done, other comic

One of the most ridiculous features of the so-called
Æsthetic movement was, that a number of brainless noodles
set to work to write poetry in <em>serious</em> imitation of Swinburne,
Rossetti, and Oscar Wilde. The style was a mixture of
mediæval Italian and middle English, and the one principle
which guided the dolorous singers was, “We must not have
any meaning, or, at any rate, the less the better.” “My
lady” was addressed in all kinds of rhymes, “Love” was
held responsible for legions of complicated woes, green eyes,
golden eyes&mdash;even orbs “like a cat’s splendid circled eye”
were quite in fashion. The recipe for this description of
poetry was&mdash;Begin with an address to your lady; never mind
if you have not one, for that is a mere detail. Represent
her as bewitching you with the unutterably weary gaze of her
eyes&mdash;or eyne&mdash;“eyne” is preferable; stick in an old word
like “teen” or “drouth” or “wot” or “sooth” or
“wearyhead” or “wanhope;” break out with “Lo!” and
“Yea!” and “Nay!” and “Ah!” at brief intervals, and
be sure to have a weird refrain. This humbug held its own
for a while, but a few unsparing satirists dealt with this
dreary small-fry of art, and the following, one of the most
delightful modern jests was prompted by the <span class="lock">school:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This masterly balderdash has imposed on many people;

<p>“<cite>John Bull</cite>” (a London newspaper) for
November 8, 1879, contained a long article
from which only the following brief notes can
be <span class="lock">quoted:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center small"><span class="sc">Immortal Pictures.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Mr. Rossetti has painted a picture, and in an unguarded
moment permitted the <cite>Athenæum</cite> to describe it in the
following language.&mdash;[<cite>Extract given in full.</cite>]</p>

<p class="blockquote"><cite>Apropos</cite> of the above fragment of art-criticism, a correspondent
sends us the following analysis (clipped from
a rival journal) of another remarkable <span class="lock">picture:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“It is better to speak the truth at once, and to say that
we have in Mr. Symphony Priggins a master as great as
the greatest; and in this picture the master-piece of a
master; and in this episode of a picture the masterstroke
of a master’s master-piece. The sublimity of Buonaroti,
the poetic fervour of Raffaelle, the tremulous intensity of
Sandro Botticelli, the correggiosity of Correggio have
never raised these masters to higher heights than our own
Priggins has attained in this transcendent rendering of
the Dish running away with the Spoon.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The artist, like some others of his craft, is, as is
known, a poet of no mean pretensions; and he has set
forth the inner meaning of his picture in the following
lines, which form the motto on its frame:&mdash;”</p>

<p>The following rather more serious imitation of Rossetti
is from “<cite>The Diversions of the Echo Club</cite>” by Bayard
Taylor. Mr. Taylor remarks that Rossetti’s poetry is
encumbered with the burden of colour, sensuous expression,
and mediæval imagery and drapery; but he forgot to
mention that Rossetti wrote as an artist, and that some of
his finest poems were written to accompany, and to
elucidate, certain of his own pictures.</p>

<div class="i1">By the tempest low was laid.</div>
<div class="i1">From that time I wandered o’er</div>
<div class="i1">Wood and valley, hill and moor;</div>
<div class="i1">Wheresoe’er the wind is blowing,</div>

<p>Before leaving Rossetti mention must be made of a
singular series of illustrated parodies which appeared in
<cite>Punch</cite>, March 3, 10, 17, 24 and 31, 1866. The illustrations,
by Du Maurier, seem to have been intended partly to
ridicule Burne Jones’s style, and partly that of Rossetti;
as to the poem, it is of the ultra weird and sensational
ballad form, with a slight dash of the “Lady of Shalott”
thrown in, and the inevitable refrain, popularly supposed
to be inseparable from Pre-raffaelite art.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">OSCAR WILDE.</h3>

<p>It would be useless to attempt to give any
parodies on the poems of Mr. Oscar Wilde
without prefacing them with some account,
however brief, of his career. In a few of the
skits the allusions are already out of date, and
in a short time the reasons will be quite forgotten
that led to the silly ridicule and misrepresentations
of which Mr. Oscar Wilde, as
the Apostle of Æstheticism, was formerly the
object.</p>

<p>Mr. Oscar O’Flahertie Wills Wilde was born in Dublin
on October 15, 1856. His father, Sir William R. Wilde,
was an eminent surgeon, and a man of literary tastes and
great archæological learning.</p>

<p>In 1851 Sir William (then Mr.) Wilde married a granddaughter
of Archdeacon Elgee, of Wexford, a lady well
known in literary circles in Dublin as having written many
poems which were published in the <cite>Nation</cite> newspaper at the
time of the political excitement in 1848. They appeared
over the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i> “Speranza,” and were afterwards
published in a collected form, entitled “Poems by
Speranza.”</p>

<p>Mr. Oscar Wilde early developed talents such as might
have been expected in the son of highly gifted parents.
Having spent about a year at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen,
Mr. Wilde studied for a year at Trinity College,
Dublin, where he obtained a classical scholarship at the
early age of sixteen, and in 1874, won the Berkeley Gold
Medal for Greek, the topic selected for that year being the
Greek Comic Poets. Thence he went to Magdalen College,
Oxford, where he obtained a first scholarship.</p>

<p>He soon began to show his taste for art and china, and
before he had been at Oxford very long, his rooms were the
show of the college, and of the university too. He was
fortunate enough to obtain the best situated rooms in the
college, on what is called the kitchen staircase, having a
lovely view over the river Cherwell and the beautiful Magdalen
walks, and Magdalen bridge. His rooms were three in
number, and the walls were entirely panelled. The two
sitting rooms were connected by an arch, where folding
doors had at one time stood. His blue china was supposed
by connoisseurs to be very valuable and fine, and there was
plenty of it. He was hospitable, and on Sunday nights
after “Common Room,” his rooms were generally the scene
of conviviality, where undergraduates of all descriptions and
tastes were to be met, drinking punch, or a B. and S. with
their cigars. It was at one of these entertainments that he
made his well-known remark, “Oh, that I could live up to
my blue china!”</p>

<p>Besides minor scholarships, he took the Newdigate, a
prize for English verse, in 1878, and a first in <cite>Literis
Humanioribus</cite>, after which he took his degree.</p>

<p>During this period he produced a number of poems, these
were published, some in <cite>The Month</cite>, others in the <cite>Catholic
Monitor</cite>, and the <cite>Irish Monthly</cite>. A number of his short
poems also appeared in <cite>Kottabos</cite>, a small magazine written
by members of Trinity College, Dublin.</p>

<p>The first number of Mr. Edmund Yates’s <cite>Time</cite>, April
1879, contained a short poem by Oscar Wilde, entitled
“The Conqueror of Time,” and to the July number he
contributed “The New Helen.” Some of the foregoing
poems, with others not previously published, appeared in
a volume, entitled “Poems” by Oscar Wilde, published
in 1881 by David Bogue, which speedily ran through
several editions.</p>

<p>When referring to this volume in “The Æsthetic

It is also necessary to refer, here to Mr. Wilde’s career

<p>The interest in the Æsthetic School had sometime since
spread to the United States, and when the opera of <cite>Patience</cite>
was produced it occurred to Mr. Wilde that a visit to the
States to give some lectures, explanatory of <em>real Æstheticism</em>
as it exists amongst us, might interest and possibly instruct
and elevate our transatlantic cousins.</p>

<p>In some of his early utterances he was unguarded; he
admitted, for instance, that he was not strongly impressed
with the mighty ocean, and great was the flow of wit from
this small <span class="lock">cause:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>From the States he went to Canada, and thence to Nova
Scotia, the Halifax <cite>Morning Herald</cite> of October 10, 1882,
gave an amusing account of an interview held with him by
their own “Interviewer.” “The apostle had no lily, nor yet
a sunflower. He wore a velvet jacket which seemed to be a
good jacket. He had an ordinary necktie and wore a linen
collar about number eighteen on a neck half a dozen sizes
smaller. His legs were in trousers, and his boots were
apparently the product of New York art, judging by their
pointed toes. His hair is the colour of straw, slightly
leonine, and when not looked after, goes climbing all over
his features. Mr. Wilde was communicative and genial;
he said he found Canada pleasant, but in answer to a
question as to whether European or American women were
the more beautiful, he dexterously evaded his querist.”</p>

<p>The remainder of the conversation was devoted to poetry;
he expressed his opinion that Poe was the greatest American
poet, and that Walt Whitman, if not a poet, is a man who
sounds a strong note, perhaps neither prose nor poetry, but
something of his own that is grand, original and unique.</p>

<p>On this topic <cite>The Century</cite>, for November, 1882, contained
an exquisitely humorous poem written by Helen Gray Cone,
describing an imaginary interview between Oscar Wilde and
the great poetical Egotist&mdash;Walt Whitman. The style and
diction of both are admirably hit off. The parody of
Whitman reads, indeed, like an excerpt from his works.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as the poem is very long, only an extract
can be <span class="lock">given:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Narcissus in Camden.</span></p>

<p>(“<cite>In the course of his lecture, Mr. Wilde remarked that the
most impressive room he had yet entered in America was the one
in Camden Town, where he met Walt Whitman. It contained
plenty of fresh air and sunlight. On the table was a simple
cruse of water.</cite>”)</p>

<p><cite>Punch</cite> also had a very funny burlesque description of</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc lowercase">“OSCAR INTERVIEWED.</span></p>

<p class="quotesig">“<i>New York, Jan.</i>, 1882.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Determined to anticipate the rabble of penny-a-liners
ready to pounce upon any distinguished foreigner who
approaches our shores, and eager to assist a sensitive Poet
in avoiding the impertinent curiosity and ill-bred insolence
of the Professional Reporter, I took the fastest pilot-boat
on the station, and boarded the splendid Cunard steamer,
<i>The Boshnia</i>, in the shucking of a pea-nut.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="sc">His Æsthetic Appearance.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“He stood, with his large hand passed through his long
hair, against a high chimney-piece&mdash;which had been
painted pea-green, with panels of peacock blue pottery let
in at uneven intervals&mdash;one elbow on the high ledge, the
other hand on his hip. He was dressed in a long, snuff-coloured,
single-breasted coat, which reached to his heels,
and was relieved with a seal-skin collar and cuffs rather
the worse for wear. Frayed linen, and an orange silk
handkerchief gave a note to the generally artistic colouring
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</i>, while one small daisy drooped despondently
in his button-hole.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="sc">His Glorious Past.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Precisely&mdash;I took the Newdigate. Oh! no doubt, every
year some man gets the Newdigate; but not every year
does Newdigate get an Oscar. Since then&mdash;barely three
years, but centuries to such as I am&mdash;I have stood upon
the steps of London Palaces&mdash;in South Kensington&mdash;and
preached Æsthetic art. I have taught the wan beauty to
wear nameless robes, have guided her limp limbs into
sightless knots and curving festoons, while we sang of the
sweet sad sin of Swinburne, or the lone delight of soft communion
with Burne-Jones. Swinburne had made a name,
and Burne-Jones had copied illuminations e’er the first
silky down had fringed my upper lip, but the Trinity of
Inner Brotherhood was not complete till I came forward,
like the Asphodel from the wilds of Arcady, to join in
sweet antiphonal counterchanges with the Elder Seers.
We are a Beautiful Family&mdash;we are, we are, we are!”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Yes; I expect my Lecture will be a success. So does
Dollar Carte&mdash;I mean D’Oyly Carte. Too-Toothless
Senility may jeer, and poor positive Propriety may shake her
rusty curls; but I am here, to pipe of Passion’s venturous
Poesy, and reap the scorching harvest of Self-Love! I am
not quite sure what I mean. The true Poet never is. In
fact, true Poetry is nothing if it is intelligible.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="sc">His Kosmic Soul.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Oh, yes! I speak most languages; in the sweet honey-tinted
brogue my own land lends me. <cite>La bella Donna della mia
Mente</cite> exists, but she is not the Jersey Lily, though I have
grovelled at her feet; she is not the Juno Countess, though
I have twisted my limbs all over her sofas; she is not the
Polish Actress, though I have sighed and wept over all
the boxes of the Court Theatre; she is not the diaphanous
Sarah, though I have crawled after her footsteps through
the heavy fields of scentless Asphodel; she is not the
golden haired Ellen, more fair than any woman Veronesé
looked upon, though I have left my <em>Impressions</em> on many
and many a seat in the Lyceum Temple, where she is High
Priestess; nor is she one of the little Nameless Naiads I
have met in Lotus-haunts, who, with longing eyes, watch
the sweet bubble of the frenzied grape. No, Sir, my real
Love is my own Kosmic Soul, enthroned in its flawless
essence; and when America can grasp the supreme whole
I sing in too-too utterance for vulgar lips, then soul and
body will blend in mystic symphonies; then, crowned with
bellamours and wanton flower-de-luce, I shall be hailed
Lord of a new Empery, and as I stain my lips in the
bleeding wounds of the Pomegranate, and wreathe my
o’ergrown limbs with the burnished disk of the Sunflower,
Apollo will turn pale and lashing the restive horses of the
Sun, the tamer chariot of a forgotten god will make way
for the glorious zenith of the one Oscar Wilde.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A “Rose” Ball.</span></p>

<p>A Rose, or Maidens’ Ball took place, in July 1885, at
Hyde Park House, which was lent for the occasion by
Mrs. Naylor-Leyland. It was a complete success, in
spite of the absence of Royalty. As a social gathering, it
was the smartest dance of the season, while, from a girl’s
point of view, there has been no ball in London to equal
it for many a day. Each fair donor paid five pounds, for
which she was allowed to ask five men, and in almost
every case the favoured five put in an appearance; so
instead of the dancing-rooms being filled with girls
anxiously looking for partners, the tables were turned, and
the black coats had to take their turn at playing wallflowers&mdash;an
amusement, to judge from some of their
remarks, that they did not all appreciate. Each maiden
carried a bouquet of roses, and almost all the floral
decorations were confined to various varieties of the same
flower.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">ARTHUR W. E. O’SHAUGHNESSY.</h3>

<p>Was born in 1844, and at the age of twenty obtained a
position in the Natural History Department of the British
Museum. In 1873 he married Miss Eleanor Marston, who
assisted her husband in some of his early works, especially
in a volume entitled “Toyland,” published in 1875.</p>

<p>But Mrs. O’Shaughnessy and her two children all died in
1879, and the unfortunate young poet did not long survive
them, he dying in London early in 1881.</p>

<p>His early books&mdash;“An Epic of Women” (1870); and
“Lays of France” (1872), were successful, but “Music and
Moonlight” (1874), was coldly received.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Martin Farquhar Tupper.</h3>

<p>This gentleman was born in London in 1810,
and educated, first at the Charterhouse school,
and afterwards at Christ Church, Oxford, where
he graduated B.A., M.A., and D.C.L. The
author of many works, both in prose and verse,
Mr. Tupper has been hardly dealt with by the
critics, and the parodists.</p>

<p>They appear to have ignored such of his
writings as have any merit, in order to hunt
most mercilessly to death his <cite>Proverbial Philosophy</cite>,
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
which, though it has run through many
editions, is inferior to much else that he has
written.</p>

<p>The reasons for this perversity on their part
cannot here be considered, only the Parodies
as they exist can be dealt with.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The following lines, which were written many years ago
by “Cuthbert Bede” in his <cite>Shilling Book of Beauty</cite>, neatly
sum up <cite>Proverbial Philosophy</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Thoughts may abide in the brain, yet how few have the wit to extract them;</div>
<div class="i1">Many may know of Proverbs, yet could not for worlds have devised them.</div>
<div class="i1">All are not gifted the same: there are brains that are stupid and addled;</div>
<div class="i1">There are those that are clear as the stream,&mdash;the pellucid water that floweth</div>
<div class="i1">Under the bridges, that bind the Surrey shore unto London.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Philosophy cannot be taught, unless you can meet with a teacher:</div>
<div class="i1">I am the teacher of this the nineteenth century of being.</div>
<div class="i1">Philosophy I can expound in a way hitherto undream’d of;</div>
<div class="i1">Witness my book of Proverbial Platitudes, and its Editions;</div>
<div class="i1">Book beloved by women&mdash;women of intellect feeble;</div>
<div class="i1">Book that is lauded by old maids, and Evangelical parsons;</div>
<div class="i1">Book that by school-girls is worshipped, and ranked with <cite>The Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>;</div>
<div class="i1">That is read by bachelor curates, to maidens at Dorcas meetings;</div>
<div class="i1">Designing curates, who choose the chapters on “Love” and “Marriage,”</div>
<div class="i1">And read the soft nothings therein, with smirks and murderous gusto.</div>
<div class="i1">I have written of Proverbs, turned everything to a Proverb,</div>
<div class="i1">Even my name as an author, proverbial is it with many,</div>
<div class="i1">Who, in braying derision, call me “Sweet Singer of Beadledom,”</div>
<div class="i1">Let those laugh who win! my Proverbs have eighteen editions!</div>
<div class="i1">Eighteen editions bring fame, and&mdash;what is better&mdash;<em>money</em>.</div>

<div class="i1">Come into this quiet box, with hot water in a batter’d pewter jug,</div>

<div class="i1">Here, upon this wooden peg, hang up thy hat and Chesterfield,</div>
<div class="i1">Order a pint of stout, or a go of grog, and rest for half-an-hour.</div>

<div class="i1">Behold! I would stop a short time in this buzzing crowd of visitors,</div>
<div class="i1">Though wrapp’d up in a mackintosh, yet are the seams and pockets pervious;</div>
<div class="i1">But into the foam of this goodly glass I dip my beak,</div>
<div class="i1">And receive its contents as nectar, yet the tap is Barclay’s.</div>
<div class="i1">Under its cheerful influence I shall, before long, get loquacious,</div>

<div class="i1">Policemen will not oft refuse a drain, if absent the inspector,</div>
<div class="i1">And policemen’s friendship should be courted in the event of rows.</div>
<div class="i1">The larker, held by the collar, may be released by half-a-crown,</div>
<div class="i1">And thy own bed is better than the stone sofas of a station house,</div>
<div class="i1">Or, being James Edwards, compelled to call thyself John Brown.</div>
<div class="i1">There is not one crusher who is proof against the waistcoat pocket,</div>
<div class="i1">And the same font of happiness hath even power over reporters.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I saw a beggar in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’s, and another beggar punch’d his head,</div>
<div class="i1">For the first had collected more coppers at his crossing than the other</div>
<div class="i1">His broom fell into the mud, and he swore an oath.</div>
<div class="i1">Anon a baked potato-man came up, with a high-pressure can,</div>
<div class="i1">And gave him of his store; the first beggar was grateful.</div>
<div class="i1">He, poor stricken cadger, picked up his broom with a curse,</div>
<div class="i1">And, turning to the potato man, asked what he would take to drink.</div>
<div class="i1">And so the sprat had been set, and the herring had been caught!</div>

<p>In <cite>Banter</cite> (a comic paper edited by Mr. G. A. Sala) for
November 11, 1867, there was a parody of Tupper, entitled
<cite>Proverbial Philosophy of Sausages</cite>, but it was not very
amusing; and in the same paper, for November 18, there
was a burlesque description of a dinner given to Mr. Tupper,
and of an after-dinner speech he delivered in which he explained
the dodges and devices he had practised in order
to puff his works, and increase the sale of <cite>Proverbial
Philosophy</cite>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Fall of Tupper.</span></p>

<p>We are too often painfully reminded that the best of us
are but very frail. A very painful case of moral declension
has occurred lately. Martin Farquhar Tupper, the great
moral philosopher at whose feet all England has sat so long
and learnt so much, that great and good man who had discovered
a new species of poetry which was neither rhyme nor
reason, but all beautiful pure sentiment, has come down to
writing rhyme! Happily he has not yet reached the next
stage&mdash;he has not fallen so low yet as to incur the suspicion
of writing reason. But this abandonment of his principles
has been, we fear, the result of bad company, for&mdash;our heart
breaks almost while we pen the words,&mdash;but it is too plain,
we cannot shut our eyes to the cruel truth&mdash;Martin Farquhar
Tupper has fallen into the power of Algernon Charles
Swinburne!! He, the purest of philosophers, the chosen
minstrel of the Evangelical Church, has been studying the
words of the erotic Pagan bard, the laureate of Venus and
Faustina!</p>

<p>We are enabled, by a wonderful effort of clairvoyance, to
publish a poem which the modest songster of <cite>The Rock</cite> has
held back, the charming domestic interest and true Protestant
flavour of which must commend it to all admirers of
Martin Farquhar <span class="lock">Tupper:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i1">Laughter was good for the gods of Homer; but we are not gods nor Homeric,</div>
<div class="i1">And laughter too audibly laughed betrays the void mind of the laugher.</div>
<div class="i1">Therefore, instead of cachinnating, I smile with supernal sarcasm</div>
<div class="i1">To think that a gnat should dare to flout the stringer of proverbial pearls</div>
<div class="i1">On silken threads of verse, strengthened and made indestructible</div>
<div class="i1">By wax from philosophy’s beehive warmed in the sun of experience;</div>
<div class="i1">But oh! Raptorial Bird! oh, vilest of all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">culicides</i>!</div>
<div class="i1">Emblems both of the critics, carnivorous and sharp-stinging reviewers,</div>
<div class="i1">I will be even with you now. I’ll fly, but not on waxen wings like silly Icarus&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Not in a balloon, or in anything on the levitation principle:</div>
<div class="i1">That was all very well for Mr. Green and M. de Montgolfier,</div>
<div class="i1">But I say that levitation is all my eye and my elbow.</div>
<div class="i1">(Proverb that verges on slang, but its uses hath slang, like adversity).</div>
<div class="i1">No levitation for me; but force like that of a cannon-ball.</div>
<div class="i1">Not that I mean to be shot out of a twelve-pounder like Zazel at the Aquarium,</div>
<div class="i1">But to be propelled by tame gunpowder. “How shall I tame it?”</div>
<div class="i1">Have you never heard of Carter the Lion King, or of Myn Heer Van Amburg?</div>
<div class="i1">Did not they tame furious mammalia? And did they tell you how they did it?</div>
<div class="i1">So shall I not tell you how I intend to tame this “villanous saltpetre.”</div>
<div class="i1">But I’ll do it, or have it done for me by “our mechanicians,”</div>
<div class="i1">They shall invent a machine to be loaded with domesticated gunpowder</div>
<div class="i1">(I patenting the discovery, of course, as the author of the suggestion),</div>
<div class="i1">That shall enable me to reign in the blue empyrean and complete the subdual of the planet</div>
<div class="i1">Which is and has been for ever so long my heritage.</div>
<div class="i1">Wo, then, wo to the gnats! wo to the Jewish-nosed eagle!</div>
<div class="i1">I put the least first and the greatest last, partly to snub the King of the Falconidæ,</div>
<div class="i1">And partly because it better suits my rhythm&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I will not say my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">metre</i> because I condemn all trammels,</div>
<div class="i1">Pouring out my soul in lines of unequal lengths <a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>occasionally relieved by hexameters.</div>
<div class="i1">Wo, wo, wo! to the eagle! Now you see I reverse things again,</div>
<div class="i1">Vice-versa-ing my apostrophe&mdash;’tis a common trick of versemen and orators&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Soon the eagle of song will soar ever so much higher than the eagle who can’t sing;</div>
<div class="i1">And he won’t like that&mdash;the other eagle I mean, of course:</div>
<div class="i1">So he’ll let himself fall into the sea like a thunderbolt.</div>
<div class="i1">(That last idea is not mine, but a Mr. Tennyson’s; have you heard of him?)</div>
<div class="i1">While as for the gnats&mdash;they are the critics, as I hinted just now, you know.</div>
<div class="i1">Sting for sting, my hearties, then! buzz for buzz! bite for bite!</div>
<div class="i1">And, as of course I am ever so much bigger than you are,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ll shrike you as the humming-bird shrikes the honey-bee&mdash;that I will.</div>

<p class="center">By <span class="sc">David Mallet</span>. &emsp; Born, 1700. &emsp; Died, 1765.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">’Twas at the silent solemn hour,</div>
<div class="i2">When night and morning meet;</div>
<div class="i1">In glided Margaret’s grimly ghost,</div>
<div class="i2">And stood at William’s feet.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Her face was like an April morn</div>
<div class="i2">Clad in a wintry cloud;</div>
<div class="i1">And clay-cold was her lily hand</div>
<div class="i2">That held her sable shroud.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So shall the fairest face appear</div>
<div class="i2">When youth and years are flown:</div>
<div class="i1">Such is the robe that kings must wear,</div>
<div class="i2">When death has reft their crown.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Her bloom was like the springing flower,</div>
<div class="i2">That sips the silver dew;</div>
<div class="i1">The rose was budded in her cheek,</div>
<div class="i2">Just opening to the view.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But love had, like the canker-worm,</div>
<div class="i2">Consumed her early prime;</div>
<div class="i1">The rose grew pale, and left her cheek&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">She died before her time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Awake! she cried, thy true love calls,</div>
<div class="i2">Come from her midnight grave:</div>
<div class="i1">Now let thy pity hear the maid</div>
<div class="i2">Thy love refused to save.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">This is the dark and dreary hour</div>
<div class="i2">When injured ghosts complain;</div>
<div class="i1">When yawning graves give up their dead,</div>
<div class="i2">To haunt the faithless swain.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Bethink thee, William, of thy fault,</div>
<div class="i2">Thy pledge and broken oath!</div>
<div class="i1">And give me back my maiden-vow,</div>
<div class="i2">And give me back my troth.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Why did you promise love to me,</div>
<div class="i2">And not that promise keep?</div>
<div class="i1">Why did you swear my eyes were bright,</div>
<div class="i2">Yet leave those eyes to weep?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">How could you say my face was fair,</div>
<div class="i2">And yet that face forsake?</div>
<div class="i1">How could you win my virgin heart,</div>
<div class="i2">Yet leave that heart to break.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Why did you say my lip was sweet,</div>
<div class="i2">And made the scarlet pale?</div>
<div class="i1">And why did I, young witless maid!</div>
<div class="i2">Believe the flattering tale?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">That face, alas! no more is fair,</div>
<div class="i2">Those lips no longer red:</div>
<div class="i1">Dark are my eyes, now closed in death,</div>
<div class="i2">And every charm is fled.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The hungry worm my sister is;</div>
<div class="i2">This winding-sheet I wear:</div>
<div class="i1">And cold and weary lasts our night,</div>
<div class="i2">Till that last morn appear.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But hark! the cock has warned me hence;</div>
<div class="i2">A long and last adieu!</div>
<div class="i1">Come see, false man, how low she lies,</div>
<div class="i2">Who died for love of you.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
<div class="i1">The lark sung loud; the morning smiled</div>
<div class="i2">With beams of rosy red;</div>
<div class="i1">Pale William quaked in every limb,</div>
<div class="i2">And raving left his bed.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He hied him to the fatal place</div>
<div class="i2">Where Margaret’s body lay;</div>
<div class="i1">And stretched him on the green-grass turf</div>
<div class="i2">That wrapped her breathless clay.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And thrice he called on Margaret’s name,</div>
<div class="i2">And thrice he wept full sore;</div>
<div class="i1">Then laid his cheek to her cold grave,</div>
<div class="i2">And word spake never more!</div>

<h3 class="h3head">The Rev. George Crabbe.</h3>

<p class="center">Born December 24, 1754. &emsp; Died Feb. 3, 1832.</p>

<p class="p2">Although the works of this author are now but little
read, they were widely popular at the time when the
brothers Smith produced <cite>The Rejected Addresses</cite> in 1812,
and naturally Mr. Crabbe’s poetry came in for imitation.
Indeed this particular imitation was singled out by Lord
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
Jeffrey as being the best piece in the collection. “It is,”
said he, “an exquisite and most masterly imitation, not
only of the peculiar style, but of the taste, temper, and
manner of description of that most original author (Crabbe),
and can hardly be said to be in any respect a caricature of
that style or manner, except in the excessive profusion of
puns and verbal jingles, which are never so thick sown in
the original works as in this admirable imitation.”</p>

<p>Even Mr. Crabbe, himself, was amused, he wrote
“There is a little ill-nature in their prefatory address;
but in their versification they have done me admirably, yet
it is easier to imitate style than to furnish matter.”</p>

<p>From this it will be gathered that the prose introduction
is as much a parody as the poem, both of which were
written by James Smith, who gives the following lines as
a fair sample of Mr. Crabbe’s <span class="lock">versification:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>A Preface of Apologies.</cite></p>

<p>If the following poem should be fortunate enough to
be selected for the opening address, a few words of explanation
may be deemed necessary, on my part, to avert
invidious misrepresentation. The animadversion I have
thought it right to make on the noise created by tuning
the orchestra, will, I hope, give no lasting remorse to any
of the gentlemen employed in the band. It is to be desired
that they would keep their instruments ready tuned, and
strike off at once. This would be an accommodation to
many well-meaning persons who frequent the theatre,
who, not being blest with the ear of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia, mistake
the tuning for the overture, and think the latter concluded
before it is begun.</p>

<div class="i1">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;one fiddle will</div>
<div class="i1">Give, half-ashamed, a tiny flourish still,”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">was originally written “one hautboy will;” but, having
providentially been informed, when this poem was on the
point of being sent off, that there is but one hautboy in
the band, I averted the storm of popular and managerial
indignation from the head of its blower: as it now stands,
“one fiddle” among many, the faulty individual will, I
hope, escape detection. The story of the flying play-bill
is calculated to expose a practice much too common, of
pinning play-bills to the cushions insecurely, and frequently,
I fear, not pinning them at all. If these lines
save one play-bill only from the fate I have recorded, I
shall not deem my labour ill-employed. The concluding
episode of Patrick Jennings glances at the boorish fashion
of wearing the hat in the one-shilling gallery. Had
Jennings thrust his between his feet at the commencement
of the play, he might have leaned forward with impunity,
and the catastrophe I relate would not have occurred.
The line of handkerchiefs formed to enable him to recover
his loss is purposely so crossed in texture and materials
as to mislead the reader in respect to the real owner of any
one of them. For in the statistical view of life and manners
which I occasionally present, my clerical profession has
taught me how extremely improper it would be, by any
allusion, however slight, to give any uneasiness, however
trivial, to any individual, however foolish or wicked.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">GEORGE BARNWELL</p>

<p>In Bishop Percy’s <cite>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</cite> is
the Ballad having this title, which the Bishop states had
been printed at least as early as the middle of the 17th century.
Upon this Ballad, George Lillo, the dramatist, founded
a tragedy, entitled “<cite>The London Merchant</cite>, or the History
of George Barnwell,” which was first performed at Drury
Lane Theatre, in 1731. Lillo departed from the ballad by
making Barnwell die repentant, thereby spoiling his dramatic
character, and the piece was faulty in other respects, yet it
held the stage for many years, and Mrs. Siddons frequently
performed the part of the fair but naughty <i>Millwood</i>, and
Charles Kemble was considered the best <i>Barnwell</i> ever seen
on the boards.</p>

<p>At the time, therefore, that <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite> were
written, and for many years afterwards, <cite>George Barnwell</cite> was
a piece thoroughly familiar to London playgoers, consequently
it was quite natural that the topic should be selected
for a burlesque, and the following was written by James
<span class="lock">Smith:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 1858 the late Mr. Shirley Brooks chose this burlesque
as the basis of a parody he composed on the ecclesiastical
procedure adopted by Samuel Wilberforce, then Bishop of
Oxford. It contains nothing more offensive to religion than
the somewhat familiar address to the Bishop as <i>Soapy Sam</i>,
the origin of which <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</i> is lost in doubt. It is said,
that when asked its meaning by a lady, Bishop Wilberforce
replied, “I believe they call me ‘Soapy Sam’ because I
am so often in hot water, and always come out with clean
hands.”</p>

<h3 class="h4head">The Imperial Institute Ode.</h3>

<p>After tremendous efforts to “puff” the so-called
“Imperial Institute” scheme into public
favour, and when the subscriptions were
coming in but slowly, the ceremony of laying
the foundation stone was gone through, with
all the solemn mummery customary on such
occasions. An Ode was necessary, and one
was accordingly written by Mr. <em>Lewis</em> Morris,
and set to music by Sir Arthur Sullivan. The
Ode contained the usual commonplaces, expressed
in language more than usually dull
and meaningless, as the following extracts will
suffice to <span class="lock">show:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3 class="h3head">NURSERY RHYMES.</h3>

<p>A learned dissertation might be written&mdash;entitled
“The Wisdom of our Nursery
Rhymes”&mdash;which should go to prove that every
important Rhyme was either founded on some
historical basis, or illustrated an old custom of
our forefathers long since fallen into oblivion.</p>

<p>Such an essay would be out of place here,
but a few notes will be inserted to show the
undoubted antiquity of such of the principal
Nursery Rhymes as have given rise to the
Parodies to be quoted.</p>

<p>Parodies of Nursery Rhymes exist in such
numbers that only a small percentage can be
inserted, especially as some of the best are of
a political and personal nature, and rapidly
become obsolete.</p>

<p>The selection has been made as carefully
and impartially as possible, with indications as
to where such other Parodies may be found as
have had to be omitted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Some of our Nursery Rhymes owe their origin to
names distinguished in our literature; as Oliver Goldsmith,
for instance, is believed in his earlier days to have
written such compositions. Dr. E. F. Rimbault gives the
following particulars as to some well-known favourites;
“Sing a Song of Sixpence,” he states, is as old as the
16th century. “The Frog and the Mouse” was licensed
in 1580. “London Bridge is broken Down” is of unfathomed
antiquity. “Girls and Boys come out to
Play” is certainly as old as the reign of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; as
is also “Lucy Locket lost her Pocket,” to the tune of
which the American song of “Yankee Doodle” was
written. “Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat, where have you been?”
is of the age of Queen Bess. “Little Jack Horner” is
older than the seventeenth century. “The Old Woman
Tossed in a Blanket” is of the reign of James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, to
which monarch it is supposed to allude.</p>

<p>J. O. Halliwell, in his “Nursery Rhymes of England,”
gives the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Three blind mice, see how they run!</div>
<div class="i1">They all ran after the farmer’s wife,</div>

<div class="i1">Did you ever see such fools in your life?</div>
<div class="i6">Three blind mice.</div>

<p class="unindent">and states that the original is to be found in “Deuteromelia;

<p>Very few would suspect that “The House that Jack built”
is a comparatively modern version of an ancient Jewish
hymn, sung at the feast of the Passover. Yet such is the
case, according to the late Dr. Halliwell Phillips, who gives
the following translation of the allegorical Talmudic Hymn,
taken from <cite>Sepher Haggadah</cite>, folio 23. This, he says, was
first translated by Professor P. N. Leberecht, of Leipsic, in
1731. The original, from which the Hebrew version was
translated, is in the Chaldaic language.</p>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p><i>The following is an interpretation of the allegory</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Kid which is one of the pure animals denotes the
Hebrews. The father, by whom it is purchased, is Jehovah,
who represents himself as sustaining this relation to the
Hebrew nation. The pieces of money signify Moses and
Aaron, through whose medium the Hebrews were brought
out of Egypt.</p>

<p>2. The Cat denotes the Assyrians by whom the ten tribes
were carried into captivity.</p>

<p>3. The dog is symbolical of the Babylonians.</p>

<p>4. The staff signified the Persians.</p>

<p>5. The fire indicates the Grecian Empire under Alexander
the Great.</p>

<p>6. The water betokens the Romans, or the fourth of the
great monarchies to whom the Jews were subjected.</p>

<p>7. The ox is a symbol of the Saracens who subdued
Palestine, and brought it under the Caliphate.</p>

<p>8. The butcher that killed the ox denotes the Crusaders
by whom the Holy Land was wrested out of the hands of
the Saracens.</p>

<p>9. The Angel of death signifies the Turkish powers by
which the land of Palestine was taken from the Franks, to
whom it is still subject.</p>

<p>10. The commencement of the tenth stanza is designed
to show that God will take signal vengeance on the Turks,
immediately after whose overthrow the Jews are to be
restored to their own land, and live under the Government
of their long expected Messiah.</p>

<p class="p2">A somewhat similar accumulative poem to the “House
that Jack built” is mentioned in Chodzko’s <cite>Popular Poetry
of Persia</cite>; it runs <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“I went upon the mountain top to tend my flock. Seeing
there a girl, I said, ‘Lass, give me a kiss.’ She said, ‘Lad,
give me some money.’ I said, ‘The money is in the purse,
the purse in the wallet, the wallet on the camel, and the
camel in Kerman.’ She said, ‘You wish for a kiss, but the
kiss lies behind my teeth, my teeth are locked up, the key is
with my mother, and my mother, like your camel, is in
Kerman.’”</p>

<p>Sir Richard Burton also gives a translation of an old Arab
story called</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Drop of Honey.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Many years ago a hunter found a hollow tree full of bees’
honey, some of which he took home in a water-skin. In the
city he sold the honey to an oilman, but in emptying out the
honey from the skin, a drop fell to the ground, whereupon
the flies flocked to it, and a bird swooped down from the
sky upon the flies. Then the oilman’s cat springs upon the
bird, and the hunter’s dog flies at the cat, and the oilman
kills the dog, and the hunter kills the oilman. Then the
men of the respective tribes took up the quarrel, and fight,
till there died of them much people, none knoweth their
number save almighty Allah!</p>

<p>This favourite nursery rhyme has been more frequently
imitated than any other, and has been especially selected as
the model on which to form political squibs and satires.</p>

<p>Some of the principal of these were published by W. Hone
(illustrated by George Cruikshank), early in the present century,
and referred to the matrimonial squabbles of the Prince
of Wales (afterwards George <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>), a topic which possesses
so little interest at present that it is not necessary to reprint
the parodies. A few of the titles may here be <span class="lock">enumerated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Loyalists’ House that Jack built.</p>

<p>In 1809, during the O. P. Riots in the new Covent Garden
theatre, many parodies were produced, and amongst them
one on this nursery rhyme. The riots arose partly from
some structural alterations made in the house, but still more
from the great increase made in the prices of admission. John
Kemble, the manager, and Madame Catalani were the principal
objects of public indignation, and the war cries of the
rioters were “Old Prices! No Private Boxes! No Catalani!
The English Drama!” In the end Kemble had to compromise
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
matters, and Catalani’s name was withdrawn from the
bills.</p>

<p><cite>The Pall Mall Gazette</cite> for April 22, 1887, contained a
Political Parody, entitled “Jubilee Coercion Bill, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 87.”
It was profusely illustrated by F. C. G., and without these

pretty well exhausted by this time.</p>

another Sermon founded on the same <span class="lock">plot:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Modern Sermons.</span></p>

<p class="center">“This is the house that Jack built.”</p>

<p>That is the first portion of my text, dear friends, so you
see that for a start we have something definite: we are not
simply told that this is the house; but that it is “the house
that Jack built.” Now, if Jack was anything, he was a far-seeing
man; for do we not read that</p>

<p class="center">“This is the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.”</p>

<p>Anticipating a rise in the price of barley, and wishing to
profit by that rise, Jack bought up all the malt that he could
get. But, like many other men, he had an enemy. This
was a rat, and of him it is said that</p>

<p class="center">“This is the rat that ate the malt.”</p>

<p>Now I do not wish to impute any greedy or selfish motives
to this rat. Probably he was well aware that it was through
malt that many men make beasts of themselves. “Beasts,”
said the rat to himself, “are already too numerous. If their
number is increased, the struggle for existence will become
fiercer: so it amounts to this, if I do not, by eating this
malt, save men from becoming beasts, we shall have to eat
our ‘brothers and our sisters, our cousins and our aunts.’ I
will either prevent such a catastrophe, or perish in the
attempt.” He perished in the attempt, for we are introduced
to his destroyer in the following words:</p>

<p class="center">“This is the cat that killed the rat.”</p>

<p>As I dealt generously with the rat, even so will I deal
with the cat. There is every reason for supposing that he
was a friend of publicans and sinners. Hear him speak for
himself: “If this rat eats all the malt, the publicans must
either raise the price of beer, or they must supply their
customers with an inferior article. This shall not be.”
Having spoken these words, he pounced on the robber, and,
intoxicated with success, imprudently shook the fruits of his
victory in the face of one of whom it is written:</p>

<p class="center">“This is the dog that worried the cat.”</p>

<p>“This is a serious question; and though we have looked
through the advertisements of Morning Governesses every
day for the last week, we are compelled to admit we have
seen nothing that seems likely to suit&mdash;at least, at present.
It is no doubt a very serious consideration, how the young
ideas of the Prince of Wales should be taught to shoot so as
to hit the mark; and it is, unfortunately, not so easy to
train up a royal child, though the railroad pace at which
education travels renders it necessary that he should be put
into a first-class train as soon as possible. Awfully impressed
with the deep importance of the question, we have
made an humble endeavour to answer it, and if the hints are
of any service to the nation, our object will be fulfilled, and
our ambition will be gratified.”</p>

<div class="poemtitle">“<span class="sc">Hey Diddle Diddle! the Cat and the Fiddle.</span>”</div>
<div class="i1">Ah! joy with me, my neighbours, joy with me,</div>
<div class="i1">And let the air resound with glad acclaims,</div>
<div class="i1">For she indeed, our furry feline friend,</div>
<div class="i1">Hath shown herself disposed to music’s charms,</div>
<div class="i1">And with the viol held in nimble paw,</div>
<div class="i1">Scrapeth the tunes of mirthful melody.</div>
<div class="i1">Meanwhile, aroused from out her careless mood,</div>
<div class="i1">The Cow forgets her grazing on the grass,</div>
<div class="i1">Forgets the blades most choice and succulent,</div>
<div class="i1">Forgets the pail defrauded of its milk,</div>
<div class="i1">Forgets the aim and tenor of her life,</div>
<div class="i1">And rapt in rumination at the sound,</div>
<div class="i1">Listens, until the sweet mysterious strains</div>
<div class="i1">Fire her most inmost soul: then wildly forth</div>
<div class="i1">In frantic frenzy speeds her wind-whirled way,</div>
<div class="i1">Stirred by the notes of feline minstrelsy.</div>
<div class="i1">But, louder comes the soul-inspiring sound,</div>
<div class="i1">Till, boiling o’er with ecstacy, she leaps</div>
<div class="i1">Far from the earth, and further still, away.</div>
<div class="i1">I may not tell the distance of her leap,</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas all too far for mortal eye to trace;</div>
<div class="i1">Yet afterwards her corse came hurtling down,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">For in the mighty magnitude of space</div>
<div class="i1">Through which she sprang with impulse unrestrained,</div>
<div class="i1">Her very swiftness had abstracted breath&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And on her hoof a substance green was found</div>
<div class="i1">Which soon, ’twas marked, was nothing else than cheese;</div>
<div class="i1">That so ’twould seem she had all but o’ertopped</div>
<div class="i1">In that one bound the far far distant moon,</div>
<div class="i1">A portion of whose substance there appeared</div>
<div class="i1">Hoof-stricken, and adhering to its foe,</div>
<div class="i1">To warn all others from such lofty leaps.</div>
<div class="i1">Then was there mourning for the direful death;</div>
<div class="i1">The horse, the hen, the labourer, and the lamb</div>
<div class="i1">Flowed down in floods of saline tears sincere:</div>
<div class="i1">While eke the cat hath stayed her viol’s notes,</div>
<div class="i1">And wipes with trembling paw each streaming eye:</div>
<div class="i1">But he, that very fiend in canine form,</div>
<div class="i1">Brawls in a bluff brutality of mirth,</div>
<div class="i1">Cries that “I’sooth it was a merry sport;”</div>
<div class="i1">Aye laughs, as if each lateral wall of ribs</div>
<div class="i1">Would burst asunder; for methinks that she</div>
<div class="i1">While yet in life, our much-lamented cow,</div>
<div class="i1">The while the dog was barking at her heel,</div>
<div class="i1">With well-aimed kick erst stretched him on the plain;</div>
<div class="i1">Wherefore at her mishap in spiteful spleen</div>
<div class="i1">He now with cachinnations fills the air.</div>
<div class="i1">Ah! would that I could end my tale aright,</div>
<div class="i1">And give to something some good attribute.</div>
<div class="i1">But no:&mdash;for in this wicked worthless world</div>
<div class="i1">Seldom we see a soul untouched by taint:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Let me then hurry o’er the final scene,</div>
<div class="i1">The shameful shift to make emolument</div>
<div class="i1">Amid the wild confusion that prevailed.</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis said the earthenware receptacle,</div>
<div class="i1">Surnamed the Dish, who, highly held in honour,</div>
<div class="i1">Maintained the meats, and lived a lordly life,</div>
<div class="i1">Struck by a sudden guilty greed of gain,</div>
<div class="i1">And noting furthermore that none espied,</div>
<div class="i1">Clutched in his grasp the partner of his trade,</div>
<div class="i1">The Spoon yclept, and, hurrying hastily,</div>
<div class="i1">Bore him away right down into the street,</div>
<div class="i1">And reached by stealth the pawnbroker’s at length,</div>
<div class="i1">Whence,&mdash;for the spoon was one of Mappin’s <span class="lock">make,&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i1">He went back richer by a good round sum,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor told to anyone his shameless sin.</div>

<p>These beautiful words, dear friends, carry with them a
solemn lesson. I propose this morning to analyze their
meaning, and to attempt to apply it, lofty as it may be, to
our every-day life.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“Old Mother Hubbard, she went to the cupboard,</div>
<div class="i1">To get her poor dog a bone.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Mother Hubbard, you see, was old; there being no mention
of others, we may presume she was alone; a widow&mdash;a
friendless, old, solitary widow. Yet, did she despair? Did
<a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>she sit down and weep, or read a novel, or wring her hands?
No! <em>she went to the cupboard</em>. And here observe that she
<em>went</em> to the cupboard. She did not hop, or skip, or run,
or jump, or use any other peripatetic artifice; she solely and
merely <em>went</em> to the cupboard. We have seen that she was
old and lonely, and we now further see that she was poor.
For, mark, the words are “<em>the</em> cupboard.” Not “one of
the cupboards,” or “the right-hand cupboard,” or “the left-hand
cupboard,” or “the one above,” or “the one below,” or
“the one under the floor,” but just “<em>the</em> cupboard,” the one
humble little cupboard the poor widow possessed. And why
did she go to the cupboard? Was it to bring forth goblets,
or glittering precious stones, or costly apparel, or feasts, or
any other attributes of wealth? <em>It was to get her poor dog a
bone!</em> Not only was the widow poor, but her dog, the sole
prop of her old age, was poor too. We can imagine the
scene. The poor dog, crouching in the corner, looking wistfully
at the solitary cupboard, and the widow going to that
cupboard&mdash;in hope, in expectation may be&mdash;to open it, although
we are not distinctly told that it was not half open,
or ajar, to open it for that poor dog.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“But when she got there the cupboard was bare,</div>
<div class="i1">And so the poor dog had none.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>When she got there! You see, dear brethren, what perseverance
is! <em>She got there!</em> There were no turnings and
twistings, no slippings and slidings, no leanings to the right,
or falterings to the left. With glorious simplicity we are told
“she got there.”</p>

<p>And how was she rewarded?</p>

<p>“The cupboard was bare!” It was bare! There were
to be found neither apples, nor oranges, nor cheesecakes,
nor penny buns, nor gingerbread, nor crackers, nor nuts, nor
lucifer matches. The cupboard was bare! There was but
one, only one solitary cupboard in the whole of the cottage,
and that one, the sole hope of the widow, and the glorious
loadstar of the poor dog, was bare! Had there been a leg
of mutton, a loin of lamb, a fillet of veal, even an ice from
Gunter’s, the case would have been very different, the incident
would have been otherwise. But it was bare, my
brethren, bare as a bald head. Many of you will probably
say, with all the pride of worldly sophistry&mdash;“The widow,
no doubt, went out and bought a dog biscuit.” Ah, no!
Far removed from these earthly ideas and mundane desires,
poor Mother Hubbard, the widow, whom many thoughtless
worldlings would despise, in that she only owned one cupboard,
perceived&mdash;or I might even say saw&mdash;at once the
relentless logic of the situation, and yielded to it with all the
heroism of that nature which had enabled her, without deviation,
to reach the barren cupboard. She did not attempt,
like the stiff-necked scoffers of this generation, to war against
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
the inevitable; she did not try, like the so-called man of
science, to explain what she did not understand. She did
nothing. “The poor dog had none.” And then at this
point our information ceases. But do we not know sufficient?
Are we not cognisant of enough? Who would dare
to pierce the veil that shrouds the ulterior fate of Old Mother
Hubbard&mdash;her poor dog&mdash;the cupboard&mdash;or the bone that
was not there? Must we imagine her still standing at the
open cupboard door, depict to ourselves the dog still drooping
his disappointed tail upon the floor, the sought-for bone
remaining somewhere else? Ah, no, my brethren, we are not
so permitted to attempt to read the future. Suffice it for us
to glean from this beautiful story its many lessons; suffice it
for us to apply them, to study them as far as in us lies, and,
bearing in mind the natural frailty of our nature, to avoid
being widows; to shun the patronymic of Hubbard; to
have, if our means afford it, more than one cupboard in the
house; and to keep stores in them all.</p>

<p>And oh! dear friends, keep in recollection what we have
learned this day. Let us avoid keeping dogs that are fond
of bones. But, brethren, if we do, if fate has ordained that we
should do any of these things, let us then go, as Mother Hubbard
did, straight, without curvetting and prancing, to our
cupboard, empty though it be,&mdash;let us, like her, accept the
inevitable with calm steadfastness; and should we, like her,
ever be left with a hungry dog and an empty cupboard, may
future chroniclers be able to write also in the beautiful words
of our <span class="lock">text&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">“And so the poor dog had none.”</p>

<p><cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, April 21, 1888, contained the following
interesting account of the origin of this singular jeu d’esprit:</p>

<p>This is not a “burlesque” of the story of ‘Mother Hubbard,’
but a good-humoured parody of the popular (?)
“regulation” sermon. It appeared originally in 1877, in a
novel by Lord Desart, who claimed it in a letter to the <cite>Pall
Mall Gazette</cite> in December, 1886, in which he says that “one
of his characters delivered it as a mock sermon,” and adds
that it has been copied into “most of the provincial English
and Scotch, and into many American and Canadian newspapers.”
He <span class="lock">adds:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“I myself heard it preached by a negro minstrel at Haverley’s,
New York; it has been neatly printed, with an
introduction, by a clergyman, and sent round to his brother
preachers as an example of how not to do it; it was bought
for a penny in a broadsheet form in the City a year or two
ago by a friend of mine; it has been heard at countless
penny readings and entertainments of the kind; it has appeared
among the facetiæ of a guide-book to Plymouth and
the South Coast; and in a volume published by the owners
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jacob’s Oil, as well as in another jest-book; and the
other day I was shown it in a collection of <i>ana</i>, just published
by Messrs. Routledge &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, for a firm in Melbourne; and
all this without any acknowledgment of its authorship whatsoever.
Perhaps you will allow me, through your columns,
to claim my wandering child&mdash;‘a poor thing, but mine
own.’”</p>

<p>The following old rhyme was sung to the tune of Chevy
Chace. It was taken from a poetical tale in the “Choyce
Poems” printed in London in 1662. John Poole introduced
the song in his <cite>Hamlet Travestie</cite> in 1810, without
any acknowledgment, perhaps thinking it was too well
known to require mention.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Tale.</span></p>

<p>Mary was the proprietress of a diminutive incipient
sheep, whose outer covering was as devoid of colour as congealed
atmospheric vapour, and to all localities to which
Mary perambulated, her young South-down was morally
sure to follow. It tagged her to the dispensary of learning
one diurnal section of time, which was contrary to all
precedent, and excited cachinnation to the seminary attendants
when they perceived the presence of a young mutton
at the establishment of instruction. Consequently the
preceptor expelled him from the interior, but he continued
to remain in the immediate vicinity, without fretfulness,
until Mary once more became visible.</p>

<p>“What caused this specimen of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus ovis</i> to bestow
so much affection on Mary?” the impetuous progeny
vociferated.</p>

<p>“Because Mary reciprocated the wool-producer’s esteem,
you understand,” the teacher answered.</p>

<span class="sc">he</span> following poems, devoted entirely
to the laudation of Tobacco, either
as smoked in the pipe, cigar, or
cigarette, or as taken in the form of
snuff, have been collected from
many different works. One of the principal
sources of information has been that entertaining
journal <cite>Cope’s Tobacco Plant</cite>, which has
now unfortunately ceased to exist. Another useful
authority was a little book published at the
office of <cite>Tobacco</cite> in Gracechurch Street, London,
entitled <cite>Tobacco Jokes for Smoking Folks</cite>, which
contained many amusing anecdotes, and
humorous illustrations. A few of the latter
are here inserted by the kind permission of
the proprietors. Following the Parodies some
of the most noted <cite>Poems</cite> on Tobacco are given,
so as to make the collection on this interesting
topic more complete.</p>

<p>One of the earliest burlesque poems in praise of Tobacco
was that written by Mr. Isaac Hawkins Browne about one
hundred and fifty years ago, entitled “<cite>A Pipe of Tobacco</cite>, in
imitation of Six Several Authors.”</p>

<p>This poem has been repeatedly reprinted, although there
is little in it that strikes a modern reader as either remarkably
humorous or clever. The authors imitated are Colley
Cibber (the Poet Laureate), Ambrose Phillips, James
Thomson, Edward Young, Alexander Pope, and Jonathan
Swift, Dean of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s. It is stated that the imitation
of Ambrose Phillips was not written by Mr. I. H. Browne,
but was sent to him by a friend, whose name has not been
transmitted to us. This is to be regretted, as this particular
imitation (the second) is generally considered the best in the
collection. According to Ritson this was written for the
collection by Dr. John Hoadley.</p>

<div class="i1">To smoke or not to smoke, that is the question:</div>

<div class="i1">Which some would say was nothing but a faintness;</div>

<div class="i1">To snore&mdash;perchance to dream! and half your senses scare</div>
<div class="i1">With visionary demons or nightmare;</div>
<div class="i1">To wake, in perspiration nicely dished,</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis a consummation hardly to be wished;</div>

<div class="i1">To smoke, or not to smoke&mdash;that is the question!</div>

<div class="i1">And trust the warnings of a scribbling doctor,</div>

<div class="i1">And risk consumption and its thousand ills</div>
<div class="i1">The practice leads to&mdash;’tis a consummation</div>
<div class="i1">Discreetly to be shunned. To smoke, to puff&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">To puff, perhaps to doze&mdash;ay, there’s the rub;</div>
<div class="i1">For in that dozing state we thirsty grow,</div>
<div class="i1">And, having burned the tube up to a stump,</div>
<div class="i1">We must have drink, and that’s one cause</div>
<div class="i1">We modern youth are destined to short life;</div>
<div class="i1">For who can bear to feel his mouth parched up,</div>
<div class="i1">His throat like whalebone and his chest exhausted,</div>
<div class="i1">His head turned giddy, and his nerves unstrung,</div>
<div class="i1">When he himself might drench these ills away</div>
<div class="i1">With wine or brandy? Who could live in smoke,</div>
<div class="i1">And pine and sicken with a secret poison;</div>
<div class="i1">But that the dread of breaking o’er a rule</div>
<div class="i1">Prescribed by Fashion, whose controlling will</div>
<div class="i1">None disobey, puzzles ambitious youth,</div>
<div class="i1">And makes us rather bear the ills we feel</div>
<div class="i1">Than others that the doctor warns us of.</div>
<div class="i1">Thus custom does make spectres of us all,</div>
<div class="i1">And thus the native hue of our complexion</div>
<div class="i1">If sicklied o’er with a consumptive cast;</div>

<div class="i1">“‘Courage!’ he said, and pointed towards the land;</div>

<div class="i1">“Land ho!” he cried “I see it now,” says he,</div>
<div class="i2">“This jolly breeze will fetch us soon to land.”</div>
<div class="i2">Towards night they got there, time for early tea,</div>
<div class="i1">A land where tea seemed ever smoking hot to stand.</div>
<div class="i2">Thick clouds of smoke, by sleepy breezes fanned,</div>
<div class="i1">Twined, serpent like, o’er all, in curves and twists;</div>
<div class="i2">The setting sun glared red and angry, close at hand,</div>
<div class="i1">And from his steaming brow fell off the mists,</div>
<div class="i1">As falls the sweat from boxers, boxing with their fists.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></div>
<div class="i2">A land of smokers! smoking fast were some,</div>
<div class="i1">Quick, restless puffers wand’ring to and fro;</div>
<div class="i2">And some, with drowsy eyes and senses dumb,</div>
<div class="i1">Rolled heavy smoke-clouds very long and slow.</div>
<div class="i2">The strangers saw the smokers come and go</div>
<div class="i1">Along the shore, in groups of eight and sometimes ten,</div>
<div class="i2">From somewhere up above to somewhere down below;</div>
<div class="i1">Strange, dingy faces, strongly-perfumed men,</div>

<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></div>
<div class="i2">The sun went out, the moon began to rise,</div>

<div class="i1">Is heard afar, and vast musquitoes sing,</div>
<div class="i2">Who buzz and nearer buzz, then ’light and sting;</div>
<div class="i1">A place where all things always sleepy feel!</div>
<div class="i2">And round about and in and out, on odorous wing,</div>
<div class="i1">With faces like an owl, and tail unlike an eel,</div>
<div class="i1">The red-eyed ghosts of old Tobacco-smokers steal.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></div>
<div class="i2">Great leaves of that disgusting weed they brought,</div>

<div class="i2">Whereof they gave to each, but who once caught</div>
<div class="i1">The taste, from him the strangely-smelling stuff</div>
<div class="i2">Took all good sense, nor said he ever, “hold! enough;”</div>
<div class="i1">The ocean’s voice he heard as tho’ it spake</div>
<div class="i2">To some one else; his own grew thick and gruff,</div>
<div class="i1">And half asleep and scarcely half awake,</div>
<div class="i1">An everlasting puffing, puffing he did make.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></div>
<div class="i2">They sat them down upon the dingy shore,</div>
<div class="i1">Betwixt the moonlight and the moonlight’s ray,</div>
<div class="i2">And closed their eyes with heavy eyelids o’er,</div>
<div class="i1">And saw the “old folks’” faces far “at home” away;</div>
<div class="i2">But dark and dismal seemed the tossing bay,</div>
<div class="i1">Dismal the hammock’s swing, the boatswain’s cry.</div>
<div class="i2">Then one man said, “We won’t go home, to-day!”</div>
<div class="i1">And all at once chimed in, “Agreed say I;</div>

<h3 class="h3head">POEMS IN PRAISE OF TOBACCO.</h3>

<p>In the following pages the poems are thus
arranged&mdash;on Tobacco generally, on the Pipe,
Cigar and Cigarette, and on Snuff. No poets
have been found, however, to sing the praise of
chewing Tobacco, a very old form of enjoying
the weed. This habit is now principally confined
to sailors, soldiers, policemen and others,
whose duties compel them to remain in solitude
for many hours at a stretch without the solace
of a pipe. The following amusing letter shows
the importance a sailor attaches to his <span class="lock">Quid:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p2 center ls">THE INDIAN WEED.</p>

<p>Many versions exist of the following very old song, and
the history of it is somewhat contradictory and confusing.
It has been ascribed to George Wither (1588-1667), and
was originally published in 1631, in a volume entitled <cite>The
Soules Solace</cite>, by Thomas Jenner. Another version was
printed in 1672 in “Two Broadsides against Tobacco.”</p>

<p>One version commenced with the following stanza:</p>

<div class="i1">The sky it was dark, and the way it was long,</div>
<div class="i2">When I mounted his Majesty’s Mail;</div>
<div class="i1">And I tried to chirrup a cheery song</div>
<div class="i2">In the teeth of the wind and the hail;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">But it wouldn’t do&mdash;so on night’s dark face</div>
<div class="i2">I said there should glitter <em>one</em> star;</div>
<div class="i1">And I took from snug sleep in its own cozy case,</div>
<div class="i2">And lit up into life a cigar.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And then, as its sweet breath came forth with good-will,</div>
<div class="i2">The sky didn’t look half so gruff;</div>
<div class="i1">’Till I felt like a player or poet, who still</div>
<div class="i2">Gets more happy at every puff.</div>
<div class="i1">And said I to myself, since mere vapour thus soothes,</div>
<div class="i2">Why should men their bliss ever mar?</div>
<div class="i1">Life’s cold spots it warms, and its rough places smoothes,</div>
<div class="i2">And each pleasure is but a cigar!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But&mdash;like Hope, self-consuming before its own <span class="lock">fire&mdash;</span></div>
<div class="i2">It silently wasted away;</div>
<div class="i1">And I was too happy to stop to inquire</div>
<div class="i2">If there was such a thing as decay.</div>
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
<div class="i1">It was gone! and I could not another one light!</div>
<div class="i2">But the lesson in love’s stronger far;</div>
<div class="i1">Ere the embers of one flame have ceased to be bright,</div>
<div class="i2">Light another&mdash;just like a cigar!</div>

<div class="i1">A small boy puffed at a big cigar</div>
<div class="i2">His eyes bulged out and his cheeks sank in:</div>
<div class="i1">He gulped rank fumes with his lips ajar,</div>
<div class="i2">While muscles shook in his youthful chin.</div>
<div class="i1">His gills were green, but he smole a smile;</div>
<div class="i1">He sat high up on the farmyard stile,</div>
<div class="i1">And cocked his hat o’er his glassy eye,</div>
<div class="i1">Then wunk a wink at a cow near by.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The earth swam round, but the stile stood still,</div>
<div class="i2">The trees rose up and the kid crawled down</div>
<div class="i1">He groaned aloud for he felt so ill,</div>
<div class="i2">And knew that cigar had “done him brown.”</div>
<div class="i1">His head was light, and his feet like lead,</div>
<div class="i1">His cheeks grew white as a linen spread,</div>
<div class="i1">While he weakly gasped, as he gazed afar,</div>

<p>At the request of numerous subscribers the
following very humorous parody of Sir Walter
Scott’s “Young Lochinvar” is here given,
although somewhat out of its proper order.
The parody, which is a favourite piece
with reciters, has been kindly sent by Mr. C.
H. Stephenson, of Southport.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Och, Paddy Dunbar is come out of the West,</div>
<div class="i1">In all broad <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles his brogue was the best,</div>
<div class="i1">And, save his shillelah, he weapon had none,</div>
<div class="i1">He walked by himself, when he walked all alone;</div>
<div class="i1">So daring in love, and so plucky in war,</div>
<div class="i1">Och, a broth of a boy now, was Paddy Dunbar.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He carried up bricks, and he carried up stone,</div>
<div class="i1">And he carried up mortar, when bricks there was none;</div>
<div class="i1">But ere he had rattled at Mulrooney’s gate,</div>
<div class="i1">The bride had consinted, poor Paddy came late,</div>
<div class="i1">And a fresh-water sailor, as niver smelt tar,</div>
<div class="i1">Was to wed the swate Norah of Paddy Dunbar.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So bowldly he marched into Mulrooney’s stall,</div>
<div class="i1">’Mongst mothers, and brothers, and cousins, and all;</div>
<div class="i1">Then spake ould Mulrooney, his fist in his hand</div>
<div class="i1">While the spalpeen of a bridegroom quite spacheless did stand,</div>
<div class="i1">“Och, come ye in pace here; or come ye in war,</div>
<div class="i1">Or to jig at our wedding, ye blaygard Dunbar?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“When I first coorted Norah, ye thought me too bould,</div>
<div class="i1">Love warms us like toddy, but sooner grows cold;</div>
<div class="i1">And now I am come, without malice or spleen,</div>
<div class="i1">To jig at your wedding, and smoke my dhudeen;</div>
<div class="i1">There are girls in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles more pretty by far,</div>
<div class="i1">Would gladly be married to Paddy Dunbar.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The bride filled a noggin, young Pat took it up,</div>
<div class="i1">He tipped off the whisky, then threw down the cup;</div>
<div class="i1">She looked down to sneeze, then looked up so sly,</div>
<div class="i1">Wid a pipe in her mouth, and a patch on her eye;</div>
<div class="i1">He took her red hand, ere her mother could bar,</div>
<div class="i1">“Here goes for a jig now,” says Paddy Dunbar.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So big was his form, and so red was her face,</div>
<div class="i1">That nivir a stall such a couple did grace;</div>
<div class="i1">While the mother did fret, and the father did fume,</div>
<div class="i1">And the bridegroom lay drunk at the end of the room:</div>
<div class="i1">And the bride-gossips whispered, “’twere better by far,</div>
<div class="i1">To have matched our fair cousin with Paddy Dunbar.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One wink o’ the eye, and one word in the ear,</div>
<div class="i1">When they reached the street door, and found the coast clear;</div>
<div class="i1">So light to his shoulder swate Norah he flung,</div>
<div class="i1">So swift o’er the gutter before him he sprung,</div>
<div class="i1">“We are gone, she is mine, over post, rail, and bar,</div>
<div class="i1">They’ll have long legs that catch us,” said Paddy Dunbar.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">There was rousing and growling in Mulrooney’s clan,</div>
<div class="i1">The Murphys and Donovans up and they ran;</div>
<div class="i1">There was racing and chasing, a deuce of a spree,</div>
<div class="i1">But the illigant Norah no more did they see:</div>
<div class="i1">So daring in love, and so plucky in war,</div>
<div class="i1">Och, a broth of a boy now was Paddy Dunbar.</div>

<p>The political adventurer Boulanger, having done all he
could to embarrass the French Government, and to create
disturbances on the eve of the opening of the great Paris
Exhibition, ignominiously fled to Belgium, when he found
that his selfish and unpatriotic conduct was likely to
bring upon him the punishment he deserved. Whilst in
Brussels he issued a ridiculously theatrical manifesto,
whereupon the Belgian Government hinted that his
presence was undesirable in that country, and in April
last he sought refuge in London. His reception was cool,
and in a few days he was completely forgotten. Boulanger,
who is fifty-two years of age, has none of the qualities
necessary in a man who aspires to be a great political
leader, and had he not been supported by the wealth and
influence of the re-actionary parties in France, he would
long since have sunk back into his native obscurity.</p>

<div class="i1">“Will you walk into my parlour?” said a spider to a fly,</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis the prettiest little parlour, sure, that ever you did spy;</div>
<div class="i1">You’ve only got to pop your head within side of the door,</div>
<div class="i1">You’ll see so many curious things you never saw before,</div>
<div class="poemright">Will you walk in pretty fly?”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“My house is always open,” says the spider to the fly,</div>
<div class="i1">“I’m glad to have the company of all I see go by;”</div>
<div class="i1">“They go in, but don’t come out again&mdash;I’ve heard of you before;”</div>
<div class="i1">“Oh yes, they do, I always let them out at my back door.</div>
<div class="poemright">Will you walk in, pretty fly?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Will you grant me one sweet kiss, then!” says the spider to the fly;</div>
<div class="i1">“To taste your charming lips, I’ve a cu-ri-os-i-ty!”</div>
<div class="i1">Said the fly, “If once our lips did meet, a wager I would lay,</div>
<div class="i1">Of ten to one, you would not after let them come away.”</div>
<div class="poemright">“Will you walk in, pretty fly?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“If you won’t kiss, will you shake hands?” says the spider to the fly,</div>
<div class="i1">“Before you leave me to myself, with sorrow sad to sigh.”</div>
<div class="i1">Says the fly&mdash;“there’s nothing handsome unto you belongs;</div>
<div class="i1">I declare you should not touch me even with a pair of tongs.”</div>
<div class="poemright">“Will you walk in, pretty fly?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“What handsome wings you’ve got,” says the spider to the fly,</div>
<div class="i1">“If I had got such a pair, I in the air would fly</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis useless all my wishing, and only idle talk,</div>
<div class="i1">You can fly up in the air, while I’m obliged to walk.</div>
<div class="poemright">Will you walk in, pretty fly?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“For the last time, now, I ask you, will you walk in, Mr. Fly?”</div>
<div class="i1">“No! if I do, may I be shot! I’m off! so now good by.”</div>
<div class="i1">Then up he springs, but both his wings were in the web caught fast!</div>
<div class="i1">The spider laughed, “ha, ha, my boy, I have you safe at last.”</div>
<div class="poemright">“Will you walk <em>out</em>, pretty fly?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And pray how are you now?” says the spider to the fly!</div>
<div class="i1">“You fools will never wisdom get, unless you dearly buy!</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis vanity that ever makes repentance come too late,</div>
<div class="i1">And you who into cobwebs run, surely deserve your fate.</div>
<div class="poemright">Listen to me, listen to me, foolish fly.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">MORAL.</div>
<div class="i1">Now, all young men take warning by this foolish little fly:</div>
<div class="i1">Pleasure is the spider, that to catch you fast will try;</div>
<div class="i1">For, although you may think that my advice is quite a bore,</div>

<div class="i1">“Will you walk into our parlour?” said the Spider to the Fly;</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis the cosiest little parlour, friend, that ever you did spy&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">The way into this parlour is quite wide, as you’re aware,</div>
<div class="i1">And, oh! we’ll do such wondrous things when once we get <em>you</em> there!</div>
<div class="i4">Then, won’t you, won’t you, won’t you, won’t you,</div>
<div class="i8">Pretty little fly?”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, as I’ve heard, this little fly was young, but wary, too,</div>
<div class="i1">And so he thought, I’ll mind my eye&mdash;the thing may be a do!</div>
<div class="i1">So “No, no!” said that little fly; “kind Sir, that cannot be,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ve heard what’s in your parlour, and I do not wish to see.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">That Spider he was portly, and that Spider he was bland,</div>
<div class="i1">And he played the part of siren for an even Older Hand.</div>
<div class="i1">Says he, “Oh, Fly, you must be tired of being on the shelf,</div>
<div class="i1">Why don’t you just step in awhile, if but to rest yourself?”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Our parlour’s snugly furnished, for expense we never spare,</div>
<div class="i1">We’ve such a nice Round Table; you shall have an easy chair.</div>
<div class="i1">It seems incomplete without you as a sort of settled guest;</div>
<div class="i1">Turn up solitary buzzing now; step in and take a rest.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">That little Fly looked longingly. Thinks he, “I <em>do</em> feel tired,</div>
<div class="i1">I’m fond of cosy parties, and I like to be admired.</div>
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
<div class="i1">Yet I have a slight suspicion that the thing may be a trap&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I twig something in the corner&mdash;I distrust that fat old chap.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So “I’ll wait a little longer,” to the Spider said the Fly,</div>
<div class="i1">As he spread his wings (with friend Col-lings), and fluttered towards the Skye.</div>
<div class="i1">But whether he’ll come back again, and try that parlour yet,</div>
<div class="i1">Is a thing on which a cautious man would hardly like to bet.</div>

<p>The Prince of Wales was christened on January 25, 1842,
for which occasion a very handsome cake was prepared,
but it was remarked that it remained uncut, the Queen
appearing unwilling to spoil this remarkable specimen of
confectionary.</p>

<p>A Nursery Ballad, entitled “The Christening Cake,”
was published on the occasion, (by Mr. John Lee, of 440,
West Strand,) from which a few extracts may be <span class="lock">quoted:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="i2">She never could be King.</div>
<div class="i1">But ere the year its course had run,</div>
<div class="i2">What universal joy!</div>
<div class="i1">On Lord Mayor’s Day there came to light</div>
<div class="i2">A glorious princely Boy!</div>
<div class="i1">The Queen gazetted him next week,</div>
<div class="i2">The caudle ran in pails;</div>
<div class="i1">She girded on his little sword,</div>
<div class="i2">And called him “Prince of Wales.”</div>
<div class="i1">“The christening shall be superb,</div>

<div class="i1">The Queen and Prince, like other folks,</div>

<p>This ballad shows that the Queen had a reputation for
parsimony as long ago as 1842, the moral it enforces is

<p>It is somewhat curious that Poets should so often select
incidents in the lives of Royal personages as topics for their
poems, considering how ephemeral is the interest they
excite.</p>

<p>The above ballad was, of course, only a burlesque, and
had no claim to longevity, but of all the <em>serious</em> adulatory
poems written about the Queen, and her family, during the
last fifty years how many have survived? With the exception
of some few lines in Tennyson’s Dedications and
Odes, the present generation knows nothing of them.</p>

<p>Where is Leigh Hunt’s poem on the birth of the
Princess Royal? Where is Professor Aytoun’s Ode on the
Marriage of the Prince of Wales? Where, oh, where is
Mr. <em>Lewis</em> Morris’s Ode for the Opening of the Imperial
Institute? Forgotten, all forgotten, and nearly as obsolete
as the Birthday Odes of the Poets-Laureate Eusden,
Warton, and Pye.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">JOHN DRYDEN.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Born</span> August 9, 1631. &emsp; | &emsp; <span class="sc">Died</span> May 1, 1700.</p>

<p>(<i>Was Poet Laureate from 1670 till the accession
of William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> in 1688, when he was superceded by
a Protestant poet, Thomas Shadwell.</i>)</p>

<p>In the year 1683, a musical society was formed in London
for the celebration of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia’s Day, and from that
time a festival was held annually on November the 22nd
in Stationers’ Hall, and an Ode, composed for the occasion,
was sung. These festivals continued, with a few interruptions,
down to the year 1744, and some were held at even
a later date; but these celebrations must not be confounded
with the performances given by the “Cecilian”
Society, which was established in 1785.</p>

<p>A collection of the Odes, written for the Festival of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Cecilia’s Day, was first formed by Mr. William Henry
Husk, Librarian of the Sacred Harmonic Society, and published
by Bell and Daldy in 1857, in “<cite>An Account of the
Musical Celebrations on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia’s Day</cite>. To which is
appended a Collection of Odes on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia’s Day.” It
is unnecessary to enumerate them all here, but as Odes
written by Nahum Tate, John Dryden, Thomas Shadwell,
Samuel Wesley, Joseph Addison, William Congreve,
Alexander Pope, and the burlesque Ode by Bonnell
Thornton are included, the volume has considerable literary
interest.</p>

<p>John Dryden wrote a song for the Festival of November,
1687, but his great Ode, “Alexander’s Feast; or, the
Power of Music,” was written and performed in 1697.
For this poem it is said Dryden received forty pounds, its
success was so great that it was frequently performed at
later festivals, and in 1736 “Alexander’s Feast” was set
to music by Handel. The poem has been frequently parodied,
it will therefore be convenient to give the original
Ode, followed by the parodies, or such parts of them as
are fit for re-publication, for it must be confessed that
some of the earlier imitations are excessively coarse.</p>

Being a Collection of Fugitive Poems written since
the publication of Pranceriana and the Appendix. Dublin:
Printed in the year <abbr title="1779">M.DCC.LXXIX.</abbr>” This volume opens
with a very satirical dedication to the Right Honourable
Sir J&mdash;n B&mdash;q&mdash;re, Knight of the Bath, Alnager of all
<span class="sc">Ireland</span>, and Bailiff of Phœnix Park; in this he is taken
to task for “placing the most improper man in the
Kingdom at the head of our College.” The College alluded
to was Trinity College, Dublin, and the individual who
had been appointed at its head was nicknamed the
“Prancer,” as “more fit to be a dancing master than a
Provost.”</p>

in <abbr title="Volume nine">Vol. ix.</abbr> of <cite>The Spirit of the Public Journals</cite>, 1806,

<div class="i5">With notable disgrace,</div>
<div class="i3">Taken, taken, taken, taken,</div>
<div class="i5">Taken by the Speaker’s mace,</div>
<div class="i5">And caged within the Tower:</div>
<div class="i3">Afraid at his return to meet</div>
<div class="i3">Th’ expectant rabble in the street,</div>
<div class="i3">He skulks incog to Piccadilly&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Did ever patriot look so silly?</div>
<div class="i1">Long, long, and longer grows the hero’s face:</div>
<div class="i3">He meditates, in sullen mood,</div>
<div class="i5">On fickle popularity:</div>
<div class="i3">He’d blush, if blush reformer could,</div>

<div class="i3">By those who on corruption feed,</div>
<div class="i3">From his own realm in fear he flies,</div>
<div class="i5">To England turns his anxious eyes,</div>

<div class="i3">Until there lingered scarce a soul;</div>
<div class="i5">The wet had cleared the ground below,</div>

<div class="i5">Thinking&mdash;he’d better go.</div>

<p>In November 1884 Mr. Alexander Henderson produced a
new comic opera at the Comedy Theatre, London, entitled
<cite>The Great Mogul</cite>. In this piece Miss Florence <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John had
to appear with live snakes writhing about her, an innovation
which was not appreciated by the audience, whilst the songs
written by H. B. <a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Farnie, were received with derision.
Although the house was packed with the friends of the
Lessee, on the opening night (for no money was taken at the
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>

<div class="i2">(There was no money’s jingling sound).</div>
<div class="i2">The gentle Farnie stood aside,</div>
<div class="i2">And all the preparations eyed</div>
<div class="i2">With all a mighty author’s pride.</div>
<div class="i3">And then they cried&mdash;that peerless pair</div>

<div class="i2">And first the “house” did to applause give vent,</div>

<div class="i3">For Farnie to the wings had flung</div>
<div class="i3">All rules for writing verse ’twas plain,</div>

<p>But in a little work, printed in 1676, entitled “Anima

<p>These lines allude to Jerome Cardan, the Astrologer
(1501-1576), to William Lilly, also an Astrologer (1602-1681),
and to Ubaldo Guido, an Italian Mathematician
(1540-1601). Dryden was a firm believer in astrology, and
as he must, in all probability, have been well acquainted
with this book, it is probable these lines were in his mind
when he composed his own more polished epigram.</p>

<p>On page 233, <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> 2, of this Collection, a number of
parodies of the Epigram will be found, but the following

<p>There is a little confusion in these lines, both Madame
Agnesi and Mrs. Somerville were born in the same “age”
if by that <em>century</em> is meant, and although Hypatia talked
Greek she was an Egyptian, whilst Mrs. Somerville was
not English at all, having been born in Scotland. Hypatia,
a female philosopher in Alexandria, was brutally
murdered by an ignorant mob; Madame Agnesi, an
Italian lady of great scientific attainments, died a <em>Blue</em>
Nun in a convent at Milan in 1799. Mrs. Mary Somerville
wrote several scientific books, of which perhaps the
best known was “The Connection of the Physical Sciences.”</p>

<p>By Dr. James Drake, then an Undergrad of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s
College, Cambridge, printed in <cite>Anonymiana</cite>, 1809.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Biographies of John Dryden are so numerous and accessible
that it is unnecessary here to discuss the weak points
of his character. To use the mildest language possible, he
was a time-server, a turncoat, and a court sycophant. He
had written in praise of Oliver Cromwell, he wrote equally
laudatory verses on Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, he had strongly defended
the Protestant religion, yet within a twelvemonth of the
accession of the Catholic James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> the following entry
appeared in Evelyn’s Diary, January 19, 1686: “Dryden,
the famous play writer, and his two sons, and Mrs. Nelly
(Miss to the late King) were said to go to mass; such proselytes
were no great loss to the Church.” His conversion
brought him Court patronage, and in April 1687 he published
a defence of his new religion in verse, entitled “<cite>The
Hind and the Panther</cite>.” This was a long allegorical poem
in which the Hind represented the Catholic Church, and the
Panther the Protestant Church of England. It gave rise
to much controversy, and many burlesques were written
upon it, ridiculing the work, and the character of
its author. The most famous of these parodies was
one of exquisite humour, the joint production of Charles
Montague (the future Earl of Halifax) and Matthew Prior.
This was called “The Hind and the Panther Transversed
to the story of the Country Mouse and the City Mouse.”
The principal characters in the famous farce <cite>The Rehearsal</cite>,
Bayes, Smith, and Johnson, were revived in this witty production,
which is unfortunately much too long to reprint.

<p>Dryden’s Odes for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia’s Day have already been
mentioned, and in 1708 Pope was also induced, by Richard
Steele, to write an ode for the annual festival. This is
acknowledged to be the finest poem of its kind that had
appeared since Dryden’s odes were produced. In fact,
as Pope himself said, “Many people would like my ode
on music better if Dryden had never written on that subject.
It was at the request of Mr. Steele that I wrote mine;
and not with any thought of rivalling that great man,
whose memory I do, and have always reverenced.”</p>

<p>Pope chose the mythological story of Orpheus and
Eurydice as the theme for his ode; it is too long to quote in
full, but the first verse, and last quatrain, will serve as key
notes for the parodies which follow.</p>

Ode on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia’s Day, adapted to the Ancient British
Musick,” which is said to have been set to music with
characteristic accompaniments by Dr. Arne, and performed
on the Saint’s day, November 22, 1749. This appears
somewhat doubtful, it was however set to music in 1759 by
Dr. Burney, who has left the following account of his work
and its performance: “In 1759 I set for Smart and
Newbery, Thornton’s Burlesque Ode on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia’s Day.
It was performed at Ranelagh in masks, to a very crowded
audience, as I was told, for I then resided in Norfolk.
Beard sang the Salt-box song, which was admirably
accompanied on that instrument by Brent, the fencing
master, and father of Miss Brent, the celebrated singer;
Skeggs on the broomstick as bassoon, and a remarkable
performer on the Jew’s Harp, ‘Buzzing twangs the iron
lyre.’ Cleavers were cast in bell metal for this entertainment.
All the performers of the Old Woman’s oratory,
employed by Foote, were, I believe, employed at Ranelagh
on this occasion.”</p>

<p>Boswell mentions that Dr. Johnson was much diverted
with the humour of this ode.</p>

<p class="center sc">An Ode on</p>

<p class="center sc">Saint Cecilia’s Day.</p>

<p>Adapted to the Antient British Musick: viz. The <i>Salt-Box</i>,
the <i>Jew’s Harp</i>, the <i>Marrow-Bones</i> and <i>Cleavers</i>, the
<i>Hum-Strum</i> or <i>Hurdy Gurdy</i>, etc.</p>

<p>With an introduction, giving some account of these truly
British Instruments.</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="sc">Bonnell Thornton</span>, Esquire.</p>

<p>The Preface, which is too long to quote in full, concludes
with the following remarks. “If this Ode contributes
in the least to lessen our false taste in admiring
that foreign Musick now so much in vogue, and to recall
the ancient British spirit, together with the ancient British
harmony, I shall not think the pains I employed on the
composition entirely flung away on my countrymen. This
Ode, I am sensible, is not without faults; though I cannot
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
help thinking it far superior to the odes of Johnny Dryden,
Joe Addison, Sawney Pope, Nick Rowe, little Kit Smart,
etc, etc, etc, or of any that have written, or shall write on
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia’s day.”</p>

<p>“I have strictly adhered to the rule of making <em>the sound
echo to the sense</em>.”</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">MOCK HEROIC POEMS.</p>

<p>Numerous imitations exist of Pope’s <cite>Dunciad</cite>,
and the poets of the last century, and the early
years of this, exercised considerable ingenuity
in ringing the changes on the title, as will be
seen from the following list. It must not,
however, be concluded that the works mentioned
are all <em>parodies</em>, except in the cases where
the opening lines are quoted. One of the
most scholarly of these productions was “<cite>The
Scribleriad</cite>,” written by Richard Owen Cambridge,
and published in 1751. In his preface
he mentions Boileau’s <cite>Lutrin</cite>, Garth’s <cite>Dispensary</cite>,
and Pope’s <cite>Rape of the Lock</cite> and
<cite>Dunciad</cite>, each of which, he considers, have a
thousand beauties, but neither of which comes
up to the true idea of a Mock-Heroic Poem.
In fact he does not believe it was the <em>primary
idea</em> of either of the authors to write a Mock-Heroic,
whereas that was the task he set
<span class="pageno">180</span>
himself in composing The <cite>Scribleriad</cite>. He gives
the following apposite remarks on <cite>Parody</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Athenians were so fond of Parody, that they
eagerly applauded it, without examining with what propriety
or connection it was introduced. <cite>Aristophanes</cite> showed no
sort of regard to either, in his ridicule of Euripides; but
brings in the characters as well as verses of his tragedies, in
many of his plays, though they have no connection with the
plot of the play, nor any relation to the scene in which they
are introduced. This love of Parody is accounted for by
an excellent French critic, from a certain malignity in mankind,
which prompts them to laugh at what they most
esteem, thinking they, in some measure, repay themselves
for that involuntary tribute which is exacted from them
by merit.”</p>

<p><cite>The Baviad</cite>, a paraphrastic imitation of the First satire
of Persius, by William Gifford. London, 1794. This was
written to ridicule a certain <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clique</i> of self-admirationists
known as the “Della-Cruscan school,” and was very
effectual in its object. It was followed by <cite>The Maeviad</cite>, by
the same author, which completed the work <cite>The Baviad</cite>
had commenced, and the spurious poetry of the Della-Cruscan
school was laughed out of existence. The footnotes
to these satires are delicious reading, as Gifford has
selected the most amusing examples of bathos, and inflated
nonsense, from the poems of Anna Matilda, Merry,
Parsons, Jerningham, Bell, Mrs. Robinson, and Della-Crusca,
to illustrate his points.</p>

<p><cite>The Beeriad</cite>, or Progress of Drink. An Heroic Poem, in
Two Cantos, the first being an imitation of <cite>The Dunciad</cite>, the
second a description of a <cite>Ram Feast</cite>, held annually in a particular
small district of Hampshire. By a Gentleman in the
Navy. Gosport. J. Philpot. 1736.</p>

<p>The first canto of this poem is printed side by side with
a reprint of the first book of Pope’s Dunciad.</p>

<p><cite>The Beeriad</cite> commences <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><cite>The New Dunciad.</cite> This appeared in parts in a London
penny paper called <cite>The Jester</cite>, the first number of which
was published February 23, 1889. It was a weak attempt
to satirise some of the celebrities of the day, and was
destitute of interest, or poetical merit.</p>

<p><cite>The Obliviad</cite>: A Satire, with notes, together with additional
Notes, Preface, and Supplement, by the American
Editor. And the Perpetual Commentary of the <cite>Athenæum</cite>.
New York. James Millar, Broadway. London, B. Quaritch,
15, Piccadilly. 1879.</p>

<p>This is a very remarkable book, it consists of about 350
pages in all, of which at least two thirds are occupied by
Notes, critical, satirical, and biographical, dealing with the
principal writers of the day, in a most unmerciful manner.
Even <cite>The Saturday Review</cite>, which itself has a reputation for
sharp speaking, remarked (June 28, 1879):&mdash;“<cite>The Obliviad</cite> is
a laborious imitation of the Dunciad, somewhat more universally
insolent in its treatment of contemporary authors than
any other satire in prose or verse that we remember.”</p>

<p>Naturally a book which could speak with fearless truth of
the writings of such men as Tennyson, Robert Browning,
Swinburne, Dickens, Hepworth Dixon, and Robert Buchanan
created a sensation, but unfortunately the author was
almost too indiscriminate in his censures, for whilst everyone
admits that the above named authors have occasionally
written absurd and nonsensical works, it is equally certain
that they did not, in the first place, make their names and
fames in that manner.</p>

Lord Rolle), who was elected M.P. for Devon in 1784, in
the Tory interest. When <cite>The Rolliad</cite> first appeared it
had a great success, and rapidly ran through many
editions, but time has cast into oblivion most of its
allusions, and the characters introduced are well nigh
forgotten. <cite>The Rolliad</cite> was written by several authors,

<p>There are many passages in Pope’s writings which might
well be spared on account of their indelicacy, yet they are
innocent and pure as compared with some of the satires
launched at him by his enemies and rivals. The greater
number of these are too gross to be republished in a work
intended for general readers, as are also the three principal
and most amusing parodies of his works.</p>

<p>Pope’s <cite>Essay on Man</cite> was the subject of a parody, entitled
<cite>The Essay on Woman</cite>; his <cite>Eloisa to Abelard</cite> was burlesqued
in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eloisa en Déshabille</cite>; and <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite> was
parodied in a poem entitled <cite>The Rape of the Smock</cite>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
In an article on John Wilkes published in <cite>The Athenæum</cite>
in 1874, it was stated that the charge against him of having
written the infamous <cite>Essay upon Woman</cite> must now be
given up. “It is as clear as is any fact in history, that whoever
wrote the <cite>Essay</cite>, Wilkes, at all events, did not. Wilkes
was prosecuted for it, and was convicted, not however for
being the author of the poem, but for having published it.
All the statements on the trial go to show that the original
Essay was printed in red letter, and with a frontispiece, and
an engraved title.”</p>

<p>Much has been written about this parody, but its authorship
is still shrouded in mystery. In 1763 The Rev. John
Kidgell published “A Narrative of a scandalous, obscene,
and exceedingly profane libel, entitled <cite>An Essay on Woman</cite>”
to which an answer was printed in the same year. Both of
these tracts are in the British Museum. <cite>The Essay on
Woman</cite> has been recently re-published by private subscription,
but is still what is called a scarce book.</p>

<p><cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eloisa en Déshabille</cite>: Being a Parody of Mr. Pope’s
celebrated Epistle of that young lady to Abelard. By a
late celebrated Greek Professor, dedicated to the <em>Loungers</em>
of Great Britain and Ireland. 1810.</p>

<p>This witty but indelicate poem has been generally ascribed
to Professor Porson, the famous Greek scholar, who
frequently quoted passages from it. But it seems more
probable that it was written by Colonel J. Matthews, the
brother of the author of “The Diary of an Invalid.”</p>

<div class="i1">“Who shall decide,” I asked some time ago,</div>
<div class="i1">“When doctors disagree?” None seemed to know,</div>
<div class="i1">But change one word, and let the question be,</div>
<div class="i1">“Who shall decide, when critics disagree?”</div>
<div class="i1">We all are critics, not alone the men</div>
<div class="i1">Who fail to make a living by their pen.</div>
<div class="i1">And though there’s nought,&mdash;at least so poets deem,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“That’s half so sweet in life as love’s young dream,”</div>
<div class="i1">There’s nought, I think, for which one so much cares</div>
<div class="i1">As talking over other folks’ affairs.</div>
<div class="i1">And so we meet with those who sometimes say,</div>
<div class="i1">That men have too much work, too little play:</div>
<div class="i1">Others assert that men their duties shirk,</div>
<div class="i1">Have too much play, and do too little work.</div>
<div class="i1">What is the truth? Some men find life full sore,</div>
<div class="i1">Work fifteen hours of the twenty-four;</div>
<div class="i1">They say that work does nothing else but vex,</div>
<div class="i1">And vow the collar’s never off their necks.</div>
<div class="i1">Others declare the ancient precept stuff,</div>
<div class="i1">And say one day in seven’s not enough;</div>
<div class="i1">So half another day is, so to speak,</div>
<div class="i1">Transferred from work to pleasure every week,</div>
<div class="i1">While now we have, our hard-worked lives to cheer,</div>
<div class="i1">Four extra holidays in every year.</div>
<div class="i1">Truth is, to neither party should we lean,</div>
<div class="i1">But ’twixt them both essay to hit the mean;</div>
<div class="i1">Some of hard work get far too large a share,</div>
<div class="i1">And ere they’ve learned to live, they die of care.</div>
<div class="i1">Some <em>do</em> themselves as well as others too,</div>
<div class="i1">And still declare they’ve not enough to do,</div>
<div class="i1">Saunter through Life, and vow it is a gem,</div>
<div class="i1">And say they’re killing Time, while Time kills them.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Two"><span class="sc lowercase">II.</span></abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Pleasure just now indeed is quite the rage,</div>
<div class="i1">No matter sex or station, rank or age.</div>
<div class="i1">The child, we know, is tickled with a straw,</div>
<div class="i1">The boy is happy with his hoop or taw;</div>
<div class="i1">The girl at first with dolls enjoys a span,</div>
<div class="i1">But, older grown, the doll becomes a man;</div>
<div class="i1">And, in her quest for what can life enhance,</div>
<div class="i1">She gives her time to flirting and the dance.</div>
<div class="i1">Youth growing up assume a manly tone,</div>
<div class="i1">And seem to think the world is all their own,</div>
<div class="i1">And while at school imagine they are men,</div>
<div class="i1">And take to smoking and to billiards then;</div>
<div class="i1">At college, too, of classics seldom speak,</div>
<div class="i1">Think more of Cricket than they do of Greek;</div>
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
<div class="i1">Rowing and Football take up half their time,</div>
<div class="i1">Lawn-tennis too is voted “quite sublime.”</div>
<div class="i1">Thus time is spent in learning, it is true,</div>
<div class="i1">But not in learning what they ought to do.</div>
<div class="i1">Life is a game, so many people say,</div>
<div class="i1">And they win easiest who have learned to play.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Three"><span class="sc lowercase">III.</span></abbr></div>
<div class="i1">I’ve said before, and won’t my words forsake,</div>
<div class="i1">That “every woman is at heart a rake”;</div>
<div class="i1">Perhaps, I may with greater justice say,</div>
<div class="i1">Both man and woman dearly love to play.</div>
<div class="i1">A curious problem to the world they give:</div>
<div class="i1">Some live to play while others play to live;</div>
<div class="i1">And this phenomenon is seen to-day,</div>
<div class="i1">A whole profession given up to play.</div>
<div class="i1">Men its attractions cannot well refuse,</div>
<div class="i1">Their P’s neglect, but cultivate their cues;</div>
<div class="i1">While ladies, who in Fortune’s favours bask,</div>
<div class="i1">Make the pursuit of pleasure quite a task.</div>
<div class="i1">For what with concerts, and “four o’clock tea,”</div>
<div class="i1">With pictures that they “really ought to see,”</div>
<div class="i1">With conversaziones, routs, and balls,</div>
<div class="i1">And what so dear to women’s hearts, their “calls,”</div>
<div class="i1">With flower shows, and riding in the “Row.”</div>
<div class="i1">With dinners, drives, and all that’s “comme il faut,”</div>
<div class="i1">Worn out, half dead, when Saturday arrives</div>
<div class="i1">They meekly vow they’re tired of their lives,</div>
<div class="i1">But wake on Monday morning free from pain,</div>
<div class="i1">And vow they’re ready to begin again.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Four"><span class="sc lowercase">IV.</span></abbr></div>
<div class="i1">Then Sunday comes and, it must be confessed,</div>
<div class="i1">They wonder how to pass the “Day of Rest.”</div>
<div class="i1">Many, with wearied limbs and aching head,</div>
<div class="i1">Resolve to spend it cosily in bed;</div>
<div class="i1">Some drive to Richmond, if the weather’s fine,</div>
<div class="i1">And at the Star and Garter go to dine;</div>
<div class="i1">Some, as I’ve said before, to church repair,</div>
<div class="i1">“Not for the doctrine but the music there;”</div>
<div class="i1">While others, and indeed they’re not a few,</div>
<div class="i1">Resolve to spend some hours at the Zoo.</div>
<div class="i1">These seem to think Religion is displayed</div>
<div class="i1">In noting how their fellow Creature’s made:</div>
<div class="i1">They throng the walks, but oft so queerly dressed,</div>
<div class="i1">Although ’tis true they wear their “Sunday best,”</div>
<div class="i1">That e’en the animals opine, no doubt,</div>
<div class="i1">Their relatives have got a “Sunday out.”</div>
<div class="i1">The monkeys at each other grin and wink,</div>
<div class="i1">And whisper in Ape-language, “missing link!”</div>
<div class="i1">The grissly bear himself, with outstretched claw</div>
<div class="i1">Politely asks a passer for “his paw;”</div>
<div class="i1">The loving seal oft thinks he sees his kin,</div>
<div class="i1">But quite as often finds he’s taken in,</div>
<div class="i1">For now-a-days folks do not seem to feel</div>
<div class="i1">That seal-skin jackets are not always seal.</div>
<div class="i1">They see the lions feed, which call to mind</div>
<div class="i1">The fact that they themselves have not yet dined;</div>
<div class="i1">So home to dine, and pass with mis-timed jest</div>
<div class="i1">The rest of Sunday, not the Sunday’s rest,</div>
<div class="i1">Well-satisfied, howe’er, to feel and know</div>
<div class="i1">They’ve shown themselves, as well as seen the show.</div>

<p>Pope’s prologue to Addison’s tragedy of <cite>Cato</cite> is justly
considered one of the finest prologues in the language.
The following parody of it is taken from a little tract
entitled “<cite>A Succinct Description of that Elaborate Pile of
Art, called the Microcosm</cite>. With a short account of the
Solar System.” Coventry. Printed for the Proprietor Mr.
Edward Davis, 1763. The <cite>Microcosm</cite> was constructed by
Mr. Henry Bridges of Waltham Abbey, architect, it was
in the form of a Roman Temple, ten feet high by six feet
broad in the basis, and was designed to give the spectator
instruction in architecture, sculpture and astronomy.</p>

<p>“The following parody (on Pope’s prologue to Cato) was
addressed to Mr. Henry Bridges, constructor of that elaborate
piece of mechanism. <cite>The Microcosm</cite>, by Dr. Burton, of

<p>Pope was the author of numerous imitations of other
Poets, such as Chaucer, Spenser, Waller, Abraham
Cowley, the Earl of Rochester, the Earl of Dorset, and
Dean Swift. The poem in imitation of Chaucer is somewhat
coarse, that after Dr. Swift will be quoted later on,
under that author’s name.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">LORD LYTTLETON.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Burlesque Ode by Tobias Smollett.</span></p>

<p>Lord Lyttleton was not only the patron of poets, but was
also a minor poet himself. He married, in 1741, Miss
Lucy Fortescue, whose death five years afterwards gave him
a theme for a monody which contained the following
<span class="lock">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i3">In vain I look around</div>
<div class="i3">O’er all the well-known ground,</div>

<div class="i3">Where oft we used to walk,</div>
<div class="i3">Where oft in tender talk</div>
<div class="i1">We saw the summer sun go down the sky;</div>
<div class="i3">Nor by yon fountain’s side,</div>
<div class="i3">Nor where its waters glide</div>
<div class="i1">Along the valley, can she now be found:</div>
<div class="i1">In all the wide-stretched prospect’s ample bound,</div>
<div class="i3">No more my mournful eye</div>
<div class="i3">Can aught of her espy,</div>
<div class="i1">But the sad sacred earth where her dear relics lie.</div>

<h3 class="h3head">JAMES BROWN.</h3>

<p class="center">(<cite>“Baron” Brown, the Durham Poet.</cite>)</p>

<p>Hone’s <cite>Every Day Book</cite>, (<abbr title="Volume Two, page">Vol. II, p.</abbr> 1218) contains a
record of the career, and a portrait of this eccentric individual,
who lived in Newcastle-on-Tyne during the first quarter of
the present century, when he published a series of extraordinary
writings which he considered Poems, and assumed
the title of Poet-Laureate. Brown was known to be inordinately
vain, and many letters were sent him purporting to
come from the leading poets and authors of the day. All of
these he believed to be genuine, and would show them to his
friends, (who were frequently the real authors) with much
pride. These letters, which were chiefly in verse, were produced
by the law and medical students of Durham and Newcastle,
and of the Catholic College of Ushaw. In 1821,
Brown received a large parchment signed G.R. attested by
Messrs. Canning and Peel, to which was suspended a large
unmeaning seal, which he believed to be the great seal of
Great Britain, conferring upon him the title of Baron Brown
of Durham, in the County Palatine of Durham, in consequence
of a translation of his works having been the means
of converting the Mogul empire. From that moment he
assumed the name and style of “Baron Brown,” and had
a wooden box made for the preservation of his patent. Of
the poems that were sent to him only the following fragments
have been <span class="lock">preserved:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The first is an imitation of Wilson’s <cite>Isle of Palms</cite>.</p>

<div class="i1">Or dost thou hang over the lovely main</div>
<div class="i1">And list to the boatswain’s boisterous strain;</div>
<div class="i1">Or dost thou sail on sylphid wings</div>
<div class="i1">Through liquid fields of air,</div>
<div class="i1">Or, riding on the clouds afar,</div>

<div class="i1">Oh no! oh no! sweet spirit of mine</div>

Thirlwall, a precocious youth of eleven years of age, on the
occasion of receiving the present of a copy of Bloomfield’s
poem, “The Plough Boy.” The little work from which
“The Pot-boy” is extracted, is entitled “<cite>Primitiæ; or
Essays and Poems</cite>,” by Connop Thirlwall, with a preface
by his father, the Rev, Thomas Thirlwall, M.A., who
asserts that these Essays and Poems were entirely composed
by his son before he was eleven years of age, a statement
which requires considerable credulity from the reader.</p>

<div class="i5">When sweetness clings to them:</div>

<div class="i1">And, by the mid-May’s dusky leaves embowered,</div>
<div class="i2">Forget the fruitful blame, the scanty praise.</div>
<div class="i1">No sweets to them who sweet themselves were born,</div>
<div class="i2">Whose natures ooze with lucent saccharine;</div>
<div class="i1">Who, with sad repetition soothly cloyed,</div>
<div class="i5">The lemon-tinted morn</div>
<div class="i2">Enjoy, and find acetic twilight fine:</div>

<h3 class="h3head">COVENTRY PATMORE.</h3>

<p>The best known work of this poet “The
Angel in the House,” published in 1855, was
the subject of the following parody written by
Shirley Brooks in 1860:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Baby in the House.</span></div>
<div class="poemdivider"><cite>By Poventry Catmore, author of the “Angel in the
House,” etc.</cite></div>
<div class="poemdivider"><span class="ls"><i>The Doctor.</i></span></div>
<div class="i1">“A finer than your newborn child,”</div>
<div class="i2">The Doctor said, “I never saw,”</div>
<div class="i1">And I, but half believing, smiled</div>
<div class="i2">To think he thought me jolly raw.</div>
<div class="i1">And then I viewed the crimson thing,</div>
<div class="i2">And listened to its doleful squeal,</div>
<div class="i1">And rather wished the nurse would bring</div>
<div class="i2">The pap-boat with its earliest meal.</div>
<div class="i1">My wife remarked, “I fear, a snub,”</div>
<div class="i2">The Doctor, “Madam, never fear,”</div>
<div class="i1">“’Tis hard, Ma’am, in so young a cub</div>
<div class="i2">To say.” Then Nurse, “A cub! a Dear!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><i>The Glove.</i></div>
<div class="i1">“’Twere meet you tied the knocker up,”</div>
<div class="i2">The Doctor laughed, and said, “Good-bye.</div>
<div class="i1">And till you drown that yelping pup</div>
<div class="i2">Your lady will not close an eye.”</div>
<div class="i1">Then round I sauntered to the mews,</div>
<div class="i2">And Ponto heard his fate was near,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Here few of coachmen will refuse</div>
<div class="i2">A crown to spend in beastly beer!</div>
<div class="i1">And then I bought a white kid glove,</div>
<div class="i2">Lucina’s last and favourite sign,</div>
<div class="i1">Wound it the knocker’s brass above,</div>
<div class="i2">And tied it with a piece of twine.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><i>The Advertisement.</i></div>
<div class="i1">“But, Love,” she said, in gentle voice,</div>
<div class="i2">(’Twas ever delicate and low,)</div>
<div class="i1">“The fact which makes our hearts rejoice</div>
<div class="i2">So many folks would like to know.</div>
<div class="i1">My Scottish cousins on the Clyde,</div>
<div class="i2">Your uncle at Northavering Gap,</div>
<div class="i1">The Adams’s at Morningside,</div>
<div class="i2">And Jane, who sent me up the cap.</div>
<div class="i1">So do.” The new commencing life</div>
<div class="i2">The <cite>Times</cite> announced, “May 31,</div>
<div class="i1">At 16, Blackstone Place, the wife</div>
<div class="i2">Of Samuel Bobchick, of a son.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><i>The Godfathers.</i></div>
<div class="i1">“Of course your father must be one,”</div>
<div class="i2">Jemima said, in thoughtful tones;</div>
<div class="i1">“But what’s the use of needy Gunn,</div>
<div class="i2">And I detest that miser Jones.”</div>
<div class="i1">I hinted Brown. “Well, Brown would do,</div>
<div class="i2">But then his wife’s a horrid Guy.”</div>
<div class="i1">De Blobbins? “Herds with such a crew.”</div>
<div class="i2">Well love, whom have you in your eye?</div>
<div class="i1">“Dear Mr. Burbot.” Yes, he’d stand,</div>
<div class="i2">And as you say, he’s seventy-three,</div>
<div class="i1">Rich, childless, hates that red-nosed band</div>
<div class="i2">Of nephews&mdash;Burbot let it be.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><i>The Godmother.</i></div>
<div class="i1">“We ought to ask your sister Kate,”</div>
<div class="i2">“Indeed, I shan’t,” Jemima cried,</div>
<div class="i1">“She’s given herself such airs of late,</div>
<div class="i2">I’m out of patience with her pride.</div>
<div class="i1">Proud that her squinting husband (Sam,</div>
<div class="i2">You know I hate that little sneak)</div>
<div class="i1">Has got a post at Amsterdam,</div>
<div class="i2">Where luckily he goes next week.</div>
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
<div class="i1">No, never ask of kin and kith.</div>
<div class="i2">We’ll have that wife of George Bethune’s,</div>
<div class="i1">Her husband is a silver-smith,</div>
<div class="i2">And she’ll be sure to give some spoons.”</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><i>The Christening.</i></div>
<div class="i1">“I sign him,” said the Curate, Howe,</div>
<div class="i2">O’er Samuel Burbot George Bethune,</div>
<div class="i1">Then baby kicked up such a row,</div>
<div class="i2">As terrified that Reverend coon.</div>
<div class="i1">The breakfast was a stunning spread,</div>
<div class="i2">As e’er confectioner sent in,</div>
<div class="i1">And playfully my darling said,</div>
<div class="i2">“Sam costs papa no end of tin.”</div>
<div class="i1">We laughed, made speeches, drank for joy:</div>
<div class="i2">Champagne hath stereoscopic charms;</div>
<div class="i1">For when Nurse brought our little boy,</div>
<div class="i2">I saw two Babies in her arms.</div>

<div class="i2">He talked about the skies</div>
<div class="i1">In low and silent tones perhaps,</div>
<div class="i2">That drown’d all the cries</div>
<div class="i1">Bawled in the street; the waiter though</div>
<div class="i2">Said “Sir I keep my eyes</div>

<div class="i1">Full-orbed about me and I saw</div>

<div class="i1">It was a very violent cold</div>

<p>Admirers of Miss Ingelow’s fiction may be interested in
knowing the history of those funny little bits of verse with
which she enlivened the later chapters of “Fated to be
Free.” There can be no doubt that they were intended as
a delicate kind of retaliation to Mr. Calverley. As he, who
was a cunning master of every kind of metre, had thought
fit to directly parody Miss Ingelow’s most popular pieces,
by exposing and exaggerating all her worst faults, it was
only natural that she should seek to be revenged in kind.
But it is clear that the lady cannot cope with Calverley in
parody. Her verses read more like deliberate nonsense, and
lack the faculty of imitation of style in which he excelled. The
following satirical lines, from “Fated to be Free” illustrate
this point, “Crayshaw” having been substituted for
“Calverley,” doubtless for the sake of the <span class="lock">rhyme:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Beggar’s Opera,” written by Mr. John Gay, was
first produced at the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, in
1728, and was so successful that it made “Gay rich and
Rich (the lessee) gay.” This encouraged Gay to write a
sequel to it, entitled “Polly,” which was produced in
1729, but met with far less approbation.</p>

<p>An anonymous play was produced in 1773, called “The
Bow Street Opera,” on the plan of “The Beggar’s Opera,”
in which the most celebrated songs were parodied.</p>

<p>John Gay was the author of the well-known song <cite>Black-eyed
Susan</cite>, “All in the Downs the fleet was moor’d,” of
which an excellent Latin translation will be found in the
Poetical Works of Vincent Bourne.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">MATTHEW ARNOLD.</h3>

<p>In the second volume of this collection (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 236) will be
found several parodies of Matthew Arnold’s <cite>Sonnet to
George Cruikshank</cite>, and <cite>The Forsaken Merman</cite>, which had
been printed some years before. Yet a writer in the <cite>Saturday
Review</cite>, in a notice of Arnold’s poems, made the
following confession of his <span class="lock">ignorance:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Tennyson, Browning, Swinburne, and most of our
lesser poets besides, have been parodied again and again;
we do not remember to have seen a single parody of Mr.
Arnold.… There is a subtlety about the structure of his
verse and the harmony of his lines which defies imitation.”</p>

<p><cite>The Superfine Review</cite> makes such claims to omniscience
that it is refreshing to find a writer on its staff not only
stating his belief that Arnold had not been parodied, but
that his poetry <em>defied parody</em>, and this soon after the reading
world had been delighted with the following successful
burlesque, in Mr. W. H. Mallock’s <cite>The New Republic</cite>,
published in London by Messrs. Chatto &amp; <span class="lock">Windus:&mdash;</span></p>

a deterring effect on the average modern mind. To overcome

<p>For reasons which can be easily understood by those
interested in public companies it has suited the Editor of
<cite>The Financial News</cite> to cry down the ventures in which
Mr. John Thomas North is interested. It is easy enough
to sneer at him as the “Nitrate King,” and to laugh at his
Volunteer Colonelcy, but we do not hear that the Editor of
<cite>The Financial News</cite> is either so successful in business, or
so hospitable in private life, as “Colonel North of the
Horse Marines.”</p>

<p class="p2 center ls ">MR. SWINBURNE’S PROSE.</p>

<p>As a critic and a scholar Mr. Swinburne
ranks among the first of the day, yet his style
has its defects, as was clearly pointed out by a
correspondent of the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> in November
1886.</p>

<p>If one of Mr. Swinburne’s long and involved
sentences is printed side by side with one selected
from Mrs. Gamp’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">repertoire</i>, the comparison
is not altogether to the advantage of
the poet:</p>

it must be through some defect or default in ourselves if we

touches others, and these our betters as often as our equals,
so nearly; if we cannot, for example&mdash;as I may regretfully
confess that I never could&mdash;feel adequately, or in full, the
bitter sweetness that so many thousands, and most notably
among them all a better man by far and a far worthier
judge than I, have tasted in these pages of Dickens which
hold the story of Little Nell, a story in which all the
elaborate accumulation of pathetic incident and interest, so
tenderly and studiously built up, has never, to speak truth,
given me one passing thrill&mdash;in the exquisitely fit and faithful
phrase of a great living poet, “one sweet, possessive pang”
of the tender delight and pity requickened well nigh to tears
at every fresh perusal or chance recollection of that one
simple passage in “Bleak House” which describes the baby
household tended by the little sister, who leaves her lesser
charges locked up while she goes charing; a page which I
can imagine that many a man unused to the melting mood
would not undertake to read out aloud without a break.&mdash;<cite>Note

<h3 class="h3head">Prose Parodies.</h3>

<p>In the following pages a selection, as nearly
representative as it can be made, will be given
from the parodies of the works of our greatest
prose writers. Although the axiom <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le style c’est
l’homme</i> does not apply to prose with quite the
same force as to poetry, yet there are many
amusing prose burlesques, the originals of which
will at once be recognised.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most prose parodies are very
long, in dealing with these merely brief extracts
can be given, and in some cases it will only be
necessary to indicate the names of the works in
which they occur.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Prefatory Paper.</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>By the shade of Mr. Joseph Addison.</cite></p>

<p>Lest my readers, and more especially the fair part of them,
be startled to find themselves thus accosted from another
world, I take the freedom in the first place, to assure them
that I am a peaceable and altogether inoffensive ghost. In
the many private transactions whereat I have been present
unseen, I have ever observed a strict discretion.</p>

<p>The secrets of the rouge pot are as safe with me as with
my lady’s own woman: and when I have found a lover in
the closet of a dame of quality, I have taken no more notice,
than her husband himself would have done of a like accident.
Our Queen, Proserpine, being, as everybody knows, obliged
entirely to the poets for her throne and title, and taking likewise,
in her capacity of moon, no little share in their inspiration,
hath ever distinguished the whole brotherhood of us
with her singular grace: and from time to time, by her
intercession with her grim spouse, one or other of us hath the
liberty of paying a visit to the upper sphere.</p>

<p>All the condition set upon us is only this; that on our
return, we shall make such corrections in our most popular
works, as modern men and things may appear to need.</p>

<p>For the sake of mutual help in these our reforms, a few
of us have united of late into a Society, of which I have
been appointed (together with Dr. Samuel Johnson) to be
the joint secretary, or Recorder. And it may be convenient,
if, by way of introduction to the pieces now revised
and put forth, I prefix a short catalogue of their authors,
persons who, though born in different ages, do nevertheless
marvellously harmonise and agree, insomuch, that a sincerer
friendship is hardly to be met with at Court, or even among
beauties themselves.</p>

<p>(<i>Here follow descriptions of the principal authors whose
works are imitated in “Posthumous Parodies.”</i>)</p>

<p>However, it were almost too much to expect in either of
us the perfection of later judges, who have carried the art
of criticism to such a pitch of excellence, as that no mixture
whatsoever of commendation is any longer let in, to weaken
its spirit and effect.</p>

<p>For my own part, I am wonderfully pleased with this
improvement; for it helps the main end of criticism, to wit,
to make the public laugh.</p>

<p>And what author can be so blind to his own real interests,
as not to discern, how much more truly those are his friends
who point out his errors, than who puff up his vanity?</p>

<p>I know not how it hath happened, that in an assembly so
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
notable for ingenious persons as ours is, there is yet no
mixture of the fairer sort. Their absence is always a
subject of regret with me, the most unworthy of their
admirers: and it is so now in a more especial manner,
forasmuch as I foresee that many small wags will take occasion
to draw therefrom a conclusion not a little disparaging
to the sex’s wit, and so make themselves mighty merry, as
little people are ever willing, at their better’s expence. &emsp; C.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Dr. Johnson’s Ghost.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>On the re-opening of Drury Lane Theatre.</i></p>

<p>That which was organised by the moral ability of one
has been executed by the physical efforts of many, and
<span class="sc">Drury Lane Theatre</span> is now complete. Of that part
behind the curtain, which has not yet been destined to glow
beneath the brush of the varnisher, or vibrate to the
hammer of the carpenter, little is thought by the public, and
little need be said by the committee. Truth, however, is
not lo be sacrificed for the accommodation of either; and
he who should pronounce that our edifice has received its
final embellishment would be disseminating falsehood
without incurring favour, and risking the disgrace of
detection without participating the advantage of success.</p>

<p>Professions lavishly effused and parsimoniously verified
are alike inconsistent with the precepts of innate rectitude
and the practice of external policy: let it not then be
conjectured, that because we are unassuming, we are
imbecile; that forbearance is any indication of despondency,
or humility of demerit. He that is the most assured of
success will make the fewest appeals to favour, and where
nothing is claimed that is undue, nothing that is due will be
withheld. A swelling opening is too often succeeded by
an insignificant conclusion. Parturient mountains have ere
now produced muscipular abortions; and the auditor who
compares incipient grandeur with final vulgarity is reminded
of the pious hawkers of Constantinople, who solemnly
perambulate her streets, exclaiming, “In the name of the
Prophet&mdash;figs!”</p>

<p>Of many who think themselves wise, and of some who
are thought wise by others, the exertions are directed to the
revival of mouldering and obscure dramas; to endeavours
to exalt that which is now rare only because it was always
worthless, and whose deterioration, while it condemned it
to living obscurity, by a strange obliquity of moral perception,
constitutes its title to posthumous renown. To embody
the flying colours of folly, to arrest evanescence, to give to
bubbles the globular consistency as well as form, to exhibit
on the stage the piebald denizen of the stable, and the half-reasoning
parent of combs, to display the brisk locomotion
of Columbine, or the tortuous attitudinising of Punch;&mdash;these
are the occupations of others, whose ambition,
limited to the applause of unintellectual fatuity, is too
innocuous for the application of satire, and too humble for
the incitement of jealousy.</p>

<p>Our refectory will be found to contain every species of
fruit, from the cooling nectarine and luscious peach to the
puny pippin and the noxious nut. There Indolence may
repose, and Inebriety revel; and the spruce apprentice,
rushing in at second account, may there chatter with
impunity; debarred, by a barrier of brick and mortar, from
marring that scenic interest in others, which nature and
education have disqualified him from comprehending
himself.</p>

<p>Permanent stage-doors we have none. That which is
permanent cannot be removed, for, if removed, it soon
ceases to be permanent. What stationary absurdity can
vie with that ligneous barricado, which, decorated with
frappant and tintinnabulant appendages, now serves as the
entrance of the lowly cottage, and now as the exit of a lady’s
bed-chamber; at one time, insinuating plastic Harlequin
into a butcher’s shop, and, at another, yawning, as a floodgate,
to precipitate the Cyprians of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’s into the
embraces of Macheath. To elude this glaring absurdity, to
give to each respective mansion the door which the
carpenter would doubtless have given, we vary our portal
with the varying scene, passing from deal to mahogany,
and from mahogany to oak, as the opposite claims of
cottage, palace, or castle, may appear to require.</p>

<p>Amid the general hum of gratulation which flatters us
in front, it is fit that some regard should be paid to the
murmurs of despondence that assail us in the rear. They,
as I have elsewhere expressed it, “who live to please,”
should not have their own pleasures entirely overlooked.
The children of Thespis are general in their censures of the
architect, in having placed the locality of exit at such a
distance from the oily irradiators which now dazzle the eyes
of him who addresses you, I am, cries the Queen of
Terrors, robbed of my fair proportions. When the king-killing
Thane hints to the breathless auditory the murders
he means to perpetrate in the castle of Macduff, “ere his
purpose cool,” so vast is the interval he has to travel
before he can escape from the stage, that his purpose has even
time to freeze. Your condition, cries the Muse of Smiles, is
hard, but it is cygnet’s down in comparison with mine.
The peerless peer of capers and congees<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span> has laid it down
as a rule, that the best good thing uttered by the morning
visitor should conduct him rapidly to the doorway, last impressions
vying in durability with first. But when, on this
boarded elongation, it falls to my lot to say a good thing, to
ejaculate “keep moving,” or to chant “<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">hic hoc horum
genitivo</cite>,” many are the moments that must elapse ere I
can hide myself from public vision in the recesses of O. P.
or P. S.</p>

<p>To objections like these, captiously urged and querulously
maintained, it is time that equity should conclusively reply.
Deviation from scenic propriety has only to vituperate itself
for the consequences it generates. Let the actor consider
the line of exit as that line beyond which he should not soar
in quest of spurious applause: let him reflect, that in proportion
as he advances to the lamps, he recedes from nature;
that the truncheon of Hotspur acquires no additional charm
from encountering the cheek of beauty in the stage-box, and
that the bravura of Madame may produce effect, although
the throat of her who warbles it should not overhang the
orchestra. The Jove of the modern critical Olympus, Lord
Mayor of the theatric sky<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span> has, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i>, asserted, that
a natural actor looks upon the audience part of the theatre
as the third side of the chamber he inhabits. Surely, of the
third wall thus fancifully erected, our actors should, by ridicule
or reason, be withheld from knocking their heads
against the stucco.</p>

<p>Time forcibly reminds me, that all things which have a
limit must be brought to a conclusion. Let me, ere that
conclusion arrives, recall to your recollection that the pillars
which rise on either side of me, blooming in virid antiquity,
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
like two massy evergreens, had yet slumbered in their native
quarry, but for the ardent exertions of the individual who
called them into life: to his never-slumbering talents you
are indebted for whatever pleasure this haunt of the Muses
is calculated to afford. If, in defiance of chaotic malevolence,
the destroyer of the temple of Diana yet survives in
the name of Erostratus, surely we may confidently predict
that the rebuilder of the temple of Apollo will stand
recorded to distant posterity in that of&mdash;<span class="sc">Samuel

<p>Ye who listen with credulity to the whispers of noodles,
and pursue with eagerness the phantom “collection,” who
believe that binder’s promises are&mdash;binding, and that an inch
of margin to-day matters not on the morrow, attend to the
wisdom of Bonnardot, Prince of Book-Restorers. “The
greatest merit of a rare book is indisputably a margin uncut,
or at least, little and regularly cut in every way.” No
hesitating words these; no room for doubt here. An uncut
margin is the greatest merit a rare book can possess, and it
is a merit which has a well ascertained commercial value.
An eighth of an inch more or less of margin often makes a
difference in value of hundreds of dollars. Now let the

<p class="center">(<cite>From an unpublished Essay by Dr. Johnson.</cite>)</p>

<p>He that asserts the annexation of a correct cognomen
to each production to be imperative upon every author,
either strays from veracity for the sake of disseminating
falsehood, or circulates error through the possession of
congenital imbecility. Let it not be surmised that this
declaration is expressed through sensitive timidity or supported
by vacuous generalizations, for a further perusal
will speedily discover a clinching dialectic. The individual
that appends his hereditary appellation to a composition
of transcendant ability, does but seek to enervate
his intellect by encomiastic excess, and whilst he panders
to his ambition, exaggerates his energies. Such a course
indeed, is too ephemeral for the attainment by an author
of immortality, because too invidious for the approbation
of his colleagues. Of the many who consider their
cerebral progeny worthy of attentive investigation, but
few have the right to predicate correctness of their hopeful
conviction; and he that inscribes his signature on a
piece of somniferous fatuity, involves his relatives in
unmerited obloquy, whilst he exposes himself to dedecorating
derision. Amid the multitude of periodical productions
it is but reasonable that some should be devoted to the
analysis of individual idiosyncracies, and the maxims
previously unfolded may to these be pertinently applied.</p>

<p>An anonymous panegyric by an unknown friend is more
acceptable than the cringing adulation of a patent parasite,
whilst unsigned reproofs are more meritorious than
personal vituperations.</p>

<p>He that panders to an inflamed irascibility by affording
it an opportunity of illicit flagellation, does but incite an
infuriated man to rebel against the legal institutions of
his country.</p>

<p>To the contemptible criticisms of those whose opinions
are in contrariety with the superscribed, we merely reply,
that, whilst the procrastination of judgment is essential to
the perfectibility of Truth, their future ratiocinations will
still be treated with dignified derision by their magnanimous
admonishers.</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I do!”</p>

<p>I was standing at the verge of the pavement at the
bottom of Ludgate-hill, with one foot on the kerb and
the other in the kennel.</p>

<p>’Tis an attitude of irresolution and uncertainty, and
throws a man off his level. And when a man is thrown
off his level there’s no telling what may be the end of it.
I took my foot out of the kennel, and as I set it down
beside its companion on the granite I repeated my <span class="lock">exclamation&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I do!”</p>

<p>Now, ’tis an undertaking no man in the possession of
his senses would make if he was not quite sure of avoiding
the penalty. There are many inconveniences connected
with being hanged, which would incline us to hesitate. A
man of sentiment and refinement would shrink from it. The
idea of engrossing the attention of so many people, from
the Sheriff and the Ordinary down to the most ragged
beggar in the crowd, is a shock to delicacy.</p>

<p>Besides, hanging entails early rising, and early rising is
bad. Oh! great Sun! for what dost thou quit thy roseate
couch at so unearthly an hour, but to air the world for us
poor mortals?</p>

<p>Whip me the man who would rise before eleven, if he
could help it. If he couldn’t&mdash;well, ’tis different, and
there’s an end on’t.</p>

<p>But early rising is a thing I never cared for or practised;
and indeed I can think of no worse way of beginning a day
than getting up at eight to be hanged.</p>

<p>And this brings me back to my first proposition. “I’ll
be hanged if I do!” said I.</p>

<p>As I uttered the words I brought down my cane with a
smart rap on the stones&mdash;for if the intention and the deed
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">210</span>
be the same thing, as learned legists tell us, it was on the
stones that I brought it down. But between the deed and
the intention a plaguy fellow must needs thrust the foot
on which he wore his largest and tenderest corn.</p>

<p>Mine is a sensitive heart, and of a truth tenderness is a
failing that is always leading me into difficulties.</p>

<p>I could not support the sight of his anguish; and as
soon as he found the use of his voice&mdash;which was pretty
soon&mdash;I thought it best to move away.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc lowercase">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Two"><span class="sc lowercase">II.</span></abbr></p>

<p>I had not gone many steps ere I fell in with a donkey.
Now an ass is an animal I can never pass without giving
him the time of day. There is a gentle patience with
which he listens to my discourses that wins my heart in
spite of myself.</p>

<p>He was harnessed to a sort of barrow, laden with
mackerel, and he was standing in Farringdon-street to
allow the stream of traffic to pass up Ludgate-hill.</p>

<p>“’Tis ever so, Honesty!” said I; “thou and I must
e’en wait to let our betters go by. See how yon ‘Bow
and Stratford’ rolls by&mdash;mark that <em>Pickford’s</em> van&mdash;and
thou’rt obliged to wait with thy fish, though they be
perishable goods at best.”</p>

<p>As I said this I had taken up one of the mackerel, and
was moralizing over it.</p>

<p>“Come, I say, jest drop that ’ere?” said a voice. I
looked up. It was Jack’s master. “And this is thy
tyrant, then!” I thought to myself. “Thine must be a
hard lot, with one so suspicious of his kind&mdash;so devoid of
sentiment.” But I said nothing, and replaced the fish.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the tide of traffic was broken for an
instant, and the ass’s master hastened to take advantage
of it. “Kim up!” said he to Jack; and before the poor
animal could obey him, he seized him by the head and
dragged him along, dealing him at the same time a score
of heavy blows with a thick stick that he carried in his
right hand.</p>

<p>I could have found it in my heart to have given the
rascal a sound drubbing for his pains. But I refrained.
I protest I am too soft-hearted. I feared I might by
chance hurt him, or he me.</p>

<p>“Farewell, Honesty!” said I, as Jack shambled off
with his load. And then I knew not what tender emotion
stirred me, but I felt a tear trickling down my cheek.
“Farewell, Honesty!” said I again, as I put my hand
into my pocket for my kerchief.</p>

<p>It was gone!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc lowercase">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Three"><span class="sc lowercase">III.</span></abbr></p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that ’tis not the best way
to get through a story to begin at the end.</p>

<p>’Tis an unprofitable way at best, and tends to lead one
into digressions.</p>

<p>Now, digressions will be the ruin of me in this world
and the next. I shall be so beset with digressions I shall
never reach my destination.</p>

<p>’Tis a very butterfly-like temptation. Here was I set
down to write you out my journey, and I’ve not got three
steps from the bottom of Ludgate-hill.</p>

<p>And this because of my fatal failing for digression. I
had proposed to write a chapter on <em>Pickford’s</em> vans, and
another on Public Executions; but here’s the end of my
letter, and I am still standing with one foot on the kerbstone
and the other in the kennel.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>As I was writing that last sentence, I felt I could bear
it no longer. It had rung in my ears all day. I had
looked out of windows, and out of doors, and upstairs, and
downstairs, but I could not discover whence it came.</p>

<p>“I can’t get on! I can’t get on!”</p>

<p>’Twas a little plaintive voice like a child’s.</p>

<p>“I can’t get on!” This time I traced it to its source.
’Twas nothing but a little squirrel in a revolving cage.
As he ran, so his prison turned, and he still kept crying,
“I can’t get on!”</p>

<p>Oh! great principle of Liberty! was I wrong to make
the instant determination to set that poor little captive
free? My heart assures me I was not. I fumbled at the
wire-fastening. It resisted my efforts; but the squirrel
bit my fingers all the same.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>Another digression. But it shall be the last. I have
sworn it, and so there’s an end of the matter. And ’tis
no much matter either, for after all ’tis no more than
<span class="lock">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As I stood on the pavement at the bottom of Ludgate-hill,
with one foot on the kerb and the other in the kennel,
I suddenly remembered that it was <em>Lord Mayors Day</em>.</p>

<p>“Shall I go and see the show?” said I to myself. And
myself <span class="lock">answered&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I do!” And I didn’t.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">AFFECTING APPEAL.</p>

<p>Linton, a musician belonging to the orchestra
of Covent Garden Theatre, was murdered by
street robbers, who were afterwards discovered
and executed. A play was given for
the benefit of his widow and children; and the
day preceding the performance the following
appeared in one of the public prints.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">“Theatre Royal, Covent Garden.</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>“For the Benefit of Mrs. Linton, &amp;c.”</cite></p>

<p>“The Widow,” said Charity, whispering me in the ear.
“must have your mite; wait upon her with a guinea, and
purchase a box-ticket.”</p>

<p>“You may have one for five shillings,” observed Avarice,
pulling me by the elbow.</p>

<p>My hand was in my pocket, and the guinea, which was
between my finger and thumb, slipped out.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “she shall have my five shillings,”</p>

<p>“Good heaven!” exclaimed Justice, “what are you
about! Five shillings? If you pay but five shillings for
going into the Theatre, then you get value received for
your money.”</p>

<p>“And I shall owe him no thanks,” added Charity,
laying her hand upon my heart, and leading me on the way
to the Widow’s house.</p>

<p>Taking the knocker in my left hand, my whole frame
trembled. Looking round, I saw Avarice turn the corner
of the street, and I found all the money in my pocket
grasped in my hand.</p>

<p>“Is your mother at home, my dear?” said I, to a child
who conducted me into a parlour.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the infant; “but my father has not
been at home for a great while; that is his harpsichord, and
that is his violin.&mdash;He used to play on them for me.”</p>

<p>“Shall I play you a tune, my boy?” said I.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered the boy, “My mother will not let
them be touched; for since my father went abroad, music
makes her cry, and then we all cry.”</p>

<p>I looked on the violin&mdash;it was unstrung. I touched the
harpsichord&mdash;it was out of tune. Had the lyre of Orpheus
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
sounded in my ear, it could not have insinuated to my heart
thrills of sensibility equal to what I felt. It was the spirit
in unison with the flesh.</p>

<p>“I hear my mother on the stairs,” said the boy.</p>

<p>I shook him by the hand&mdash;“Give her this, my lad,” said
I, and left the house.&mdash;It rained&mdash;I called a coach&mdash;drove
to a coffee-house, but not having a farthing in my pocket,
borrowed a shilling at the bar.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Citizen.</span></p>

<p>I took a fat citizen, and having first shut him up in his
little sitting-room, I proceeded to take his picture. I
beheld his body gorged with long gratification and confinement
to the house, and I felt what kind of sickness
of the stomach it is that arises from having eaten too
much. On looking nearer, I beheld him bloated and
feverish. In sixty years the country breeze had not once
fanned his blood, and he had seen the sun and moon but
indistinctly in all that time. He was seated, or rather
buried in a large arm-chair, which stood in front of the
fire-place, and which might have served either for a chair
or a bed. A bundle of promissory notes lay on the table,
scrawled all over, the fruits of the dark and dismal days
and nights he had spent there. He had one of these
small slips of paper in his hand, and with a pen he was
etching his own signature and the day of the month, to
add it to the heap. As I darkened the little light he had,
he lifted up an eye, swimming in fat, towards the door,
bent his head forward earnestly to listen, and then went
on with his work of delight.</p>

<p>I heard the rubbing of his hands when he had with
difficulty turned his body round to place the note on the
bundle&mdash;he gave a sigh of joy. I saw the ecstasy that
entered into his soul&mdash;I burst into a laugh&mdash;I could not
contain myself at the picture which my fancy had drawn.</p>

<p>“A mad world this, my friends, a World in its lunes,
petty and other; in lunes other than petty now for sometime;
in petty lunes, pettilettes or pantalettes, about these
six weeks, ever since when this rampant androgynous
Bloomerism first came over from Yankee land. A sort of
shemale dress you call Bloomerism; a fashion of <span class="sc">Sister
Jonathan’s</span>.</p>

<p>Trowsers tight at ankles, and for most part frilled; tunic
descending with some degree of brevity, perhaps to knees,
ascending to throat and open at chemisette front, or
buttoned there; collar down-turned over neckerchief; and
crowning all, broad brimmed hat; said garments generally
feathered, trimmed, ribboned, variegated, according to the
fancies and the vanities: these, chiefly, are the outward
differences between Bloomer dress and customary feminine
Old Clothes. Not much unlike nursery-uniforms, you
think this description of costume, but rather considerably
like it, I compute. Invisible are the merits of the Bloomer
dress, such as it has. A praiseworthy point in Bloomerism
the emancipation of the ribs; an exceeding good riddance,
the deliverance from corset, trammelling genteel thorax
with springs of steel and whalebone, screwing in waist to
Death’s hour glass contraction, and squeezing lungs, liver,
and midriff into unutterable cram. Commendable, too, the
renouncement of sous-jupe bouffante, or ineffable wadding,
invented, I suppose, by some Hottentot to improve female
contour after the type of <em>Venus</em>, his fatherland’s, and not
Cythera’s. Wholesome, moreover, and convenient, the
abbreviation of trains, serving in customary female old
clothes the purpose of besom, and no other: real improvements,
doubtless, these abandonments of ruinous shams,
ridiculous unveracities, and idolatries of indescribable mud-Pythons.…
Disputes about surplices in pulpit,
and also elsewhere, give place to controversies in theatres
and lecture-halls concerning petty lunes and frilled
trowsers; paraphernalia, however, not less important than
canonicals, as I judge for one.… But here are
we, my friends in this mad world, amid the hallooings and
bawlings, and guffaws, and imbecile simperings, and
titterings, blinded by the November smoke fog of coxcombries
and vanities, stunted by the perpetual hallelujahs
of flunkeys, beset by maniacs and simpletons in the great
lunes and the petty lunes; here, I say, do we, with
Bloomerism beneath us bubbling uppermost, stand,
hopelessly upturning our eyes for the daylight of heaven,
upon the brink of a vexed unfathomable gulf of apehood
and asshood simmering for ever.”</p>

<p class="center"><cite>By Thomas Carr Lisle.</cite></p>

<p>The Tichborne Trial is ended! Yea, my brother and
<em>other</em> things are ended of which that is but a type, Looming
Portentous; verily, a sort of Fire-balloon of paper, or
of <em>papers</em> rather, <cite>Standard</cite>, <cite>Telegraph</cite>, and what not.</p>

<p>Men say “The truth is out at last.” The Truth out!
my poor brothers-nay, was the Truth ever <em>in</em>. Surely
there was <em>no</em> Truth, rather other than that.</p>

<p>And yet doth it not <em>mean</em> something, think you, this Tichborne
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
Trial, its Solicitor-Generals, Tichborne bonds, and
legal Inanities? Says it not “Is there Truth in the land,
O Israel?” “What is Truth?” said jesting Pilate, or
rather <em>where</em> is it? Cry the question into the bottomless
Inane of this our world, and what answer? Nothing but
an inarticulate response of Tichborne bonds, Solicitor-Generals,
and such.</p>

<p>Yea, they mean something, these Solicitor-Generals and
Tichborne bonds:&mdash;a Partridge-shooting, Salmon-preserving,
Dilettante Aristocracy have said so much, have said
so with lifting of hands and Reverence&mdash;we fear somewhat
of the Rotatory Calabash kind. They mean this
much, which is perhaps somewhat other than Double-barrelled
Dilettantisms would have them mean. They
mean <em>this</em> much. This England of ours believes no longer
in Truth, believes rather in a kind of <em>Sham</em> Truth, a
stucco business, much to be lamented; at least, by all
such as hold their soul for a purpose other than to save
salt, to keep them from Rottenness, Stinking, and utter
Unsavouryness. “They say unto us ‘make brick,’ and
no straw is given unto thy servants.” So might cry our
men of law, lacking Truth to work upon; but for straw
they cry <em>not</em>, thinking to make brick <em>without</em> straw; and
they make <em>no</em> brick, rather Falsity, Puffery, and
Unnature.</p>

<p>O, great Roger! these matters of thine call with a
tolerably audible voice of Proclamation, and a universal
“<em>oyez</em>,” and we English Microcosms may know that it was
verily meant in earnest that same Phenomenon, and had
its reasons for appearing there&mdash;Just and Unjust cause&mdash;<i>Dikaios</i>
and <em>Adikos Logos</em>&mdash;trying to settle or <em>get</em> themselves
settled, incessantly protesting against each being
the other, and with it may be another kind of <em>Logos</em> from
the great Universe with silent continual Beckonings trying
to revenge itself, <em>revancher</em> itself, make itself good
again.</p>

<p>For does not the Universe hold an inarticulate Sympathy
with Justice, yearning that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</i> be mine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</i>
thine. That <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</i> be mine! There is surely something
Respectable in that.</p>

<p>And what is the outcome, ask Practical men, of all
this? What is the import of the matter to us who are
<em>not</em> Rogers? Verily, my friends, this&mdash;that England is
in a state of Chronic Atropos, hath made her a covering
of Asses-ears, Midas-leavings, Sermons, parchment and
what not, hoping to sleep through it in such caloric
apparel in this Glass house of hers, knowing that glass is
no <em>conductor</em>&mdash;to Heaven’s lightning at least.</p>

<p>The Outcome of ninety-one days’ sittings, Red-tape
Philosophies, Club-room jaw-clackings, and Infernal Babel
of <cite>Telegraphs</cite> and <cite>Morning Stars</cite> is little other than&mdash;for
Rogers <cite>Newgate</cite> and the Blackness of Darkness, for those
who are not Rogers, discovery of Chronic Atropos in a
Rampant state, wholly Insuppressible, Irrepressible, and
Mad.</p>

<p>After all, is not <em>Insanity</em> just what is the matter with
this English Bull just now? Is there Sanity at all among
us butchers, bakers and candlestick-makers, red tape
dummies, black crape ludicrousnesses, Puseyisms, Benthamee
Radicalisms, Church and Statisms, Dilettantisms,
Mammonisms, double-barelled Aristocracies, and inane
Chimæras generally? Literature is, perhaps, the Sanest
thing we have just at present, at least tolerabler, impressibler,
beneficenter than mere Chaos, articulate or inarticulate.
Writers, at least, have a <em>Meaning</em>, must have a
Meaning; state some Fact or Facts, or what they take for
Fact or Facts, intelligibly, so that men may say “Thus
thinks a Man, whether he think wrong or right.”</p>

<p>And the Tichborne Trial was mad, utterly mad, with
no Truth, hardly even <em>Un</em>truth in it, but Confusion and
Roaring as of the Pit and Abyss of stupidity.</p>

<p>Did the Insanity thereof dawn upon many, think you?
One might have hoped so, have hoped that such had been
the <em>Outcome</em> which Practical Men require. One might
have hoped that the sense of the World, Judicial, Social,
and Otherwise, would have got itself resuscitated from
Asphyxia, or proved for ever irresuscitable. But, instead
thereof, we have <cite>Times</cite> Subscription-list actually now present,
and Impending Ominous Perjury-trials, fresh
Chaotic Incongruities, diabolic Floppings and Caterwaulings
hitherto thought moribund, scattering incalculable
Contagion.</p>

<p>Thus clearly doth this Roger matter preach its lesson
to mankind, teaching and preaching clearly as these
Words writ down here the Unveracity of Demiurgurships,
of Solicitor-Generals, and such Parchment Kings.</p>

<p>But, my friends, such things will not <em>last</em>, at least not
longer than Doomsday in the afternoon. It is very notable,
Demiurgurship of Judges, that loud Inane Actuality
with justice in its pocket, which rolls along there with
trumpeters blaring round it, and all the world escorting
it as mute or vocal Flunkey&mdash;go thy way. Escort it not
thou, my brother. Say unto it rather, “Loud blaring
Nonentity, no force of wigs, spectacles, and trumpets can
make thee an Entity. Thou art a <em>Non</em>entity and deceptive
Simulacrum.” Storm-clothed Caverns Cheese and
Earwigs! French and Phrygians, Zero. Ba! Moo!
Hee Haw! Hee Haw.</p>

<p>Turn we, therefore, from this jaunting, jostling, pestering
Piccadilly into the Academy&mdash;whether really Royal this
year I know not, or whether it be no more than the grandest
<cite>Graphic</cite> we have had this many months, the most illustrious
<cite>Illustrated</cite> of the year. Pause not to catch glamorous
glancing glimpses of the besodden (with rain only, think you?)
Season’s Beauties&mdash;drawn verily, each of them, by most
Special Correspondents&mdash;but step sternly on, and stop face
to face with this William&mdash;the People’s William, as the mob
hath not dubiously dubbed him. Is it the Portrait merely
or the Man himself that ye have come out for to see? Be
you friend or foe to him, is there not in this counterfeit presentment
of him&mdash;this wild, much-suffering, much-inflicting
(not on trees only) man&mdash;something which almost attaches
you? Is it not the attitude and face of a man who hath
said to Cant, ‘Begone!’ to Dilettantism, ‘Here canst
thou not be!’ and to Truth, ‘Be thou in place of all&mdash;ay,
of ‘place’ itself to me!’&mdash;a man who hath manfully defied
the ‘Time-Prince’ or Devil to his face, by all weapons, in
all places, at all times? See you not, in the earnestly,
sternly eagle-eyed look of him the ground of the enthusiasm,&mdash;The
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schwärmerei</i>,&mdash;for him? Contrast him not
odiously, but in sober, sensible silence, with the dazzling
Dizzy, the bright Beaconsfield. Which of them, both great,
is really great<em>est</em>? Which the grandest Thing and thoughtfullest
we have done lately? Which will we send to the
next Exhibition, Paris or otherwise? Which of them will
we show for our Honour, with Peace or without it, amongst
foreign nations, and for our Peace with Honour surely
amongst ourselves? Which? Consider now, if they asked
us, “Choose ye not this time, like ill-starred princess
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
’twixt axe and crown,’ but twixt the man who sways the
axe, and him who rejects (rightly doubtless) the crown;
’twixt the lopper of laurels, and the creator of crowns,
Imperial and other, that fade.” Consider now, if they
asked us, “Will you give up your William or your Benjamin,&mdash;not
little truly, and just now your Ruler&mdash;O ye lost
Tribes of Israel? Never have had any William, or never have
had any Benjamin?” Consider now both of them, all of
you, as <span class="sc">Men</span> of State, of Letters, ay, of Post-cards also if
you will! Really it were a grave question. Official persons
would doubtless answer in official language; but we, for our
part, should not we also be forced to answer, ‘Benjamin or
no Benjamin, we cannot do without William’? He is
verily ours,&mdash;not with us here and there only, in Oriental
mystery amongst us; but ours always,&mdash;<em>Fortnightly</em>, our
own <em>Contemporary</em> (or a large part of it), our best <em>Nineteenth

<p>Here, O belated wayfarer, in thy weary march in search
of the Beautiful, after painful journeying through a Realm
of æsthetic Unrealities, pause! Thou art verily at last in
presence of a <em>Man</em>. No mere clothes-bundle of humanity
this, presented before thee, smirking, pomatumed,
garnered from the Dustbin of the Ages&mdash;marvelling by
what blundering Miracle of the Destinies he finds himself
there. Wandering in this bewildering waste of ruined
canvas, that by <em>wise</em> guidance might have evolved itself into
practical <em>Breeches</em> for the Breechless in this howling naked
world&mdash;this many-tinted appalling array of painted, but,
alas, soulless Flesh&mdash;of bewigged Pomposity, of empty
Dead-Sea faces with no Souls behind them, children of
the Inane begotten in Vanity and brought forth in Vexation
of Spirit, acres of æsthetic Upholstery, Sugar-loaf
Confectionary, perpetuated Blockheadism, respectable
<em>Giggery</em>, and other like phenomena,&mdash;all jumbled together,
gibbeted in veneer and gold;&mdash;here, at last, I say, amid
this motley throng, come we on a glimpse of the Ideal, a
Giant among pigmies, a <em>Man</em> surrounded by Tailor-puppets,
a human Soul gazing out from an earnest human face
intent upon things other than mere cultivation of the
Digestive faculty. Yea, look upon him! An earnest,
passionate, restless, lean, but withal noble face. An eager
eye, but pathetic in its eagerness, looking out compassionately
on this sad oppressed world. Stern compressed
lips, an undaunted brow, with a Stormy Force hidden
under the calm exterior. Straight he looks into the Shams
and Chicanery of our insincere Charlatan age,&mdash;the keen
lightnings of his eye, and fierce thunderbolts of his tongue,
cleaving, piercing, exploding the Windbags and inflated
Bladders that in our noodle, jabbering, screech-owl
Parliament try to pass themselves as Verities and
Realities. O my brothers, look on this, a fragment of the
Real flung by some miracle amid the Unreal, of the
Invisible made Visible, embodying for us, and for those
who come after us, a picture, a semblance, an apparition, a
Verisimilitude of Greatness that will survive the cacklings
and hissings and venom-squirting propensities of a purblind
Age!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">On the Parliamentary “Closure.”</span></p>

<p>Business in these latter days the national palaver has
mostly ceased to do; talk in every variety, perorations,
objurations clamorously vehement have inundated the poor
palaver, well-nigh swamping what of sense and work remained
to it. Strange have been the sights of late, honourable
members struggling all day, all night, stormful, impetuously
rampant, found still by saffron Phœbus motioning,
dividing, weary, and reckless of everything, wishful only to
make an end. Sacred truly are the rights of minorities,
sacred too are other rights, for one the right to work and to
progress; but this right of the not honourable member,
<a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>shameless, unreasonable, treasonable to drone, and adjourn,
and divide, senselessly and hopelessly seems not sacred; not
to me, nor to the Eternal Reason. For from of old was it
not given to the strong to rule, and rule <em>well</em>, at peril of their
souls; and is not strength with the many and not the few,
shriek and expostulate though they may, passionate,
hysterical, futile&mdash;now to be overborne by the “evident
sense of the majority” arresting the inane jabberings with
true Puritan earnestness and vigour, rejoiced in by the
Empyreans, enemies of froth and the Pit. The sense of the
majority cannot too often be “evident.”</p>

<p>Went last night in wet, bad weather to Dash’s to meet
Brown. A lean, long, clothes-prop of a man, with a
bilious complexion-spectral, hideous, discordant, almost
infernal. Much common-coloured hair streaming over
narrow shoulders. Asked leave to present me with his new
volume of poems, the result being that I got to talking in
the Annandale accent, and communicated large masses of

Brown shaken as with a passing earthquake. A very

<p class="center">His observations on the equestrian statue of <br />

<p>Beyond doubt a horse&mdash;breed questionable&mdash;a horse
nevertheless. A horse, charging like an unbottled whirlwind,
kicking up behind and before; dash, plash!
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
Symptoms unmistakable. Too much other charging for
the equine-imity of this full-bodied charger from the stables
of Gulliver Swift’s Brobdingnag. Wo, intrepedest! carriest
thou not a prince astride; he that is of Wales, yet no
Welshman, no Taffy-stick; man of Three Feathers simply!
He is the great chum-chum of the sociabilities, knowest
thou not? not to be sneezed at like everyday clay. This
clay that thou upbearest on that square back of thine is of
the Pottery-Royal, good steed; hall-marked from Plantagenet
to Guelph with despisable and undespisable
Saxon-Norman-Dutch-German interweavings; yet a sound
clay, and transparent withal, not mere bric-a-brac. All
other sons of Adam bow to him; throw him, therefore, at
thy peril. See, the Inanities are coming, with them the
Lack-lustres, the Sham-aristocrats, the Brass-brains, the
Tittle-tattlers, and the Bubble-mongers. What! still
kicking! Do not these High Mightinesses affright thee?
What sayest thou to the feminine new clothes-screens that
come lilting in, puffy, protuberant, patchy? piquancy
personified; all that. Burlesques of anatomy notwithstanding.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunquam non paratus</i>.</p>

<p>Oh, Bucephalus, I am ashamed of thee; all the fineries
are here, and thou shouldst be of the inaudibles. Else,
better wert thou with thy commemorative counterpart, in
distant, hot-as-Hades Bombay. Dost thou not, like the
Heine-immortalised palm, have internal yearnings towards
the other self out there in the land of the palanquin&mdash;that
other self-made gift of to the Bombayliffs by Sir Albert
Sassoon, C.S.I.? Ridden by an H.R.H., K.G., G.C.S.I.,
and presented by a C.S.I. Kt., thou shouldst, with thy
O B C T, abide by the letter of thy compact. Look around
thee; the show is now going on; the asinines are upon
us; “Walk up! walk up!” See how they stream
through the turn-stiles; pay here, pay there, pay everywhere;
halt cabs, halt carriages; crush; press. Whoogh!
Hotter work this than shelling peas in the back kitchen
with Gretchen. Why, the very mural panels blush for
thee in all their Doulton red-hotness. Yes, they have
panelled all the inventions on these walls, from Agricola
to Bessemer, from Caxton to Walter, from Jost Amman to
Arkwright. These panels empanel thee, kicker. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach

Followers allowed there, Bucephalus, I surmise. See,
how the crowd streams down the broad steps that lead to
the great South Gallery in the West. A sunny south it
is, methinks, this day of autumn. Wo, wo; gently,
gently; thou wilt be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hors de combat</i> of a verity one of

disinvented for its entrance upon the chaos of Do-Nothingness,
which will surely come with the Inevitable

<p>Speech is silver: silence is golden. No utterance more
Orphic than this. While, therefore, as highest author,
we reverence him whose works continue heroically unwritten,
we have also our hopeful word for those who with
pen (from wing of goose loud-cackling, or seraph God-commissioned)
record the thing that is revealed.…
Under mask of quaintest irony, we detect here the deep,
storm-tost (nigh shipwracked) soul, thunder-scarred, semi-articulate
but ever climbing hopefully toward the peaceful
summits of an Infinite Sorrow.… Yes, thou poor,
forlorn Hosea, with Hebrew fire-flaming soul in thee, for
thee also this life of ours has not been without its aspects
of heavenliest pity and laughingest mirth. Conceivable
enough! Through coarse Thersites cloak, we have revelation
of the heart, wild glowing, world-clasping, that is in
him. Bravely he grapples with the life-problem as it
presents itself to him, uncombed, shaggy, careless of the
“nicer proprieties,” inexpert of “elegant diction,” yet
with voice audible enough to whoso hath ears up there on
the gravelly side-hills, or down on the splashy, Indiarubber-like
salt-marshes of native Jaalam. To this soul also
the <em>Necessity of Creating</em> somewhat has unveiled its awful
front. If not Œipuses and Electras and Alcestises, then
in God’s name Birdofredum Sawins. These also shall get
born into the world, and filch (if so need) a Zingali subsistence
therein, these lank, omnivorous Yankees of his.
He shall paint the Seen, since the Unseen will not sit to
him. Yet in him also are Nibelungen-lays and Iliads,
and Ulysses-wanderings, and Divine Comedies&mdash;if only
once he could come at them! Therein lies much, nay all;
for what truly is this which we name <em>All</em>, but that which
we do <em>not</em> possess?... Glimpses also are given us
of an old father Ezekiel, not without paternal pride, as is
the wont of such. A brown, parchment-hided old man of
the geoponic or bucolic species, gray-eyed, we fancy,
<em>queued</em> perhaps, with much weather-cunning and plentiful
September-gale memories, bidding fair in good time to
become the Oldest Inhabitant. After such hasty apparition,
he vanishes and is seen no more.… Of
“Rev. Homer Wilbur, A.M., Pastor of the First Church
in Jaalam,” we have small care to speak here. Spare touch
in him of his Melesigenes namesake, save, haply, the&mdash;blindness!
A tolerably caliginose, nephelegeretous elderly
gentleman, with infinite faculty of sermonizing, muscularized
by long practice, and excellent digestive apparatus,
and, for the rest, well-meaning enough, and with small
private illuminations (somewhat tallowy, it is to be feared)
of his own. To him, there, “Pastor of the First Church
in Jaalam,” our Hosea presents himself as a quite inexplicable
Sphinx-riddle. A rich poverty of Latin and Greek,&mdash;so
far is clear enough, even to eyes peering myopic
through horn-lensed editorial spectacles,&mdash;but naught
farther? O purblind, well-meaning, altogether fuscous
Melesigenes-Wilbur, there are things in him incommunicable
by stroke of birch! Did it ever enter that old bewildered
head of thine that there was the <em>Possibility of the
Infinite</em> in him? To thee, quite wingless (and even featherless)
biped, has not so much even as a dream of wings
ever come? “Talented young parishioner”? Among the
Arts whereof thou art <em>Magister</em>, does that of <em>seeing</em> happen
to be one? Unhappy <em>Artium Magister</em>! Somehow a
Nemean lion, fulvous, torrid-eyed, dry-nursed in broad-howling
sand-wildernesses of a sufficiently rare spirit&mdash;Libya
(it may be supposed) has got whelped among the sheep.
Already he stands wild-glaring, with feet clutching the
ground as with oak-roots, gathering for a Remus-spring
over the walls of thy little fold. In Heaven’s name, go
not near him with that fly-bite crook of thine! In good
time, thou painful preacher, thou wilt go to the appointed
place of departed Artillery-Election Sermons, Right-Hands
of Fellowship, and Results of Councils, gathered to thy
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
spiritual fathers with much Latin of the Epitaphial sort;
thou, too, shalt have thy reward; but on him the Eumenides
have looked, not Xantippes of the pit, snake-tressed,
finger-threatening, but radiantly calm as on antique gems;
for him paws impatient the winged courser of the gods,
champing unwelcome bit; him the starry deeps, the empyrean
glooms, and far-flashing splendors await.</p>

<p>In <cite>Banter</cite> (Edited by G. A. Sala) for November 11, 1867,
there is a parody on Carlyle entitled <cite>Shows and Shams</cite>,
dealing with the Lord Mayor’s Show for that year. But
the topic is exhausted, and the parody is exhausting.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Christmas Number</cite> of the <cite>World</cite> for 1879 there is
an imitation of Carlyle, descriptive of a picture called
<cite>Music in the Drawing Room</cite>, this parody is of no interest
apart from the illustration.</p>

<p>“<cite>Carlyle Redivivus</cite>, being an occasional discourse on
Sauerteig” by Smellfungus, Edited by P. P. Alexander,
M. A., was a pamphlet published in Glasgow by Mr. James
Maclehose. It was first published during Mr. Carlyle’s
lifetime, and ran through several editions. It not only
parodied Carlyle’s style, but criticised his theories.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Here then, by way of conclusion, is a piece
of real genuine Carlyleism, printed in <cite>The Times</cite>
as long ago as 1877, and not now so generally
remembered as it deserves to be.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;A rumour everywhere prevails that our miraculous
Premier, in spite of his Queen’s Proclamation of
Neutrality, intends, under cover of “care for British
interests,” to send the English Fleet to the Baltic, or do
some other feat which shall compel Russia to declare war
against England. Latterly the rumour has shifted from
the Baltic and become still more sinister, on the eastern
side of the scene, where a feat is contemplated that will
force not Russia only, but all Europe, to declare war
against us. This latter I have come to know as an indisputable
fact; in our present affairs and outlooks surely a
grave one.</p>

<p class="blockquote">As to “British interests,” there is none visible or conceivable
to me, except taking strict charge of our route to
India by Suez and Egypt; and, for the rest, resolutely
steering altogether clear of any copartnery with the Turk
in regard to this or any other “British interest” whatever.
It should be felt by England as a real ignominy to be connected
with such a Turk at all. Nay, if we still had, as,
in fact, all ought to have, a wish to save him from perdition
and annihilation in God’s world, the one future for
him that has any hope in it is even now that of being
conquered by the Russians and gradually schooled and
drilled into peaceable attempt at learning to be himself
governed. The newspaper outcry against Russia is no
more respectable to me than the howling of Bedlam, proceeding,
as it does, from the deepest ignorant egotism,
and paltry national jealousy.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">CHARLES DICKENS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Born</span>, February 7, 1812. &emsp; &emsp; <span class="sc">Died</span>, June 9, 1870.</p>

<p>On the second of August, 1879, there was a
severe storm in London, and the Editor of
<cite>The World</cite> offered prizes for the two best descriptions
of it to be written in imitation of the
style of the fifteenth chapter of <cite>Martin Chuzzlewit</cite>.
This, it will be remembered, recounts the
experiences of Martin and Mark Tapley, on
their voyage to the States. The following
were the successful compositions, which
appeared in <cite>The World</cite>, August 27, 1879.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Prize.</span></p>

<p>A bright warm close to a dull dripping week; Labour,
just paid his weekly wages by Capital, taking a friendly
cup in the alehouse porch; Capital giving a last look to
his horses and wagons, as he saunters across the Home-meadow
to his evening meal; youth of the village disporting
itself on the village green; fishers’ boats coming
in, booty-laden, from the open-sea; coastguardmen looking
anxiously out for what neither village youth, nor
Labour, nor keen-eyed Capital himself can see&mdash;a thin
dark cloud-line upon the horizon, with grey curling fringes
that point upwards and move slowly on, just as the
advance guard of a mighty army crests with its bayonets
the distant hill.</p>

<p>An hour passes. The sun sets, the cloud-bank rising
over him, and his struggling beams throwing a wan unearthly
glare across the western heavens. Ever and anon
as the wind rises, the tall poplars shake their heads and
whisper to the oaks and shrubs beneath them; then the
breeze as suddenly dies away, and again over all Nature
is spread the sable pall and deathlike silence of an impenetrable
night; or a few heavy drops patter down on
the still pool, and then cease&mdash;all again is hushed, all
restful, but yet pregnant with the rest and hush that precedes
the hurricane.</p>

<p>Ten, eleven, twelve! Does some relentless demon of the
storm, from the old church-tower, give the signal for the
war of the elements? Scarce has the midnight chime
died away when the tempest wakes. First one vivid flash,
then, before the crash reverberates from hill to hill,
another succeeds it, and another&mdash;not the ordinary fitful
change from gleam to gloom, from darkness to light, but
the mad meeting of storms from every quarter of the
heavens, in all the fulness of rage and strife, and never
ceasing turmoil.</p>

<p>Again, again! The rain seems to crash down rather
than to fall, streaming with a torrent’s force from the hillside,
foaming, rushing, seething in a thousand eddies
down to the swollen river, till the banks no longer endure
the awful pressure, and the wild flashes laugh out, fiend-like,
at trees and flocks and newly-stacked hay, all swept
adrift, all whirled oceanwards.</p>

<p>Again, again! What further ruin can the storm-demon
work? Gradually, unwillingly, the tempest departs; only
the gray scattered clouds remain, hanging on the hill
slope. Yet, as the daylight dawns, one sad cry is heard
from all, “God’s house!”</p>

<p>The chimes are for ever silent, for God’s house has
fallen! Just before the storm passed away a vivid flash
struck the topmost pinnacle and caught the oaken rafters
in the belfry&mdash;and now the roof has fallen in; the pillars
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
crumble beneath the still-consuming flame; the bells
crash down from the steeple one by one, a smoking mass
of blackened walls and arches alone bears witness to the
past, alone tells of anthems raised to heaven by the white-robed
choir, and earnest words of God’s chosen messengers,
and the all-pervading incense of hushed and solemn
prayer.</p>

<p>Murk midnight. Some in their beds for a moment
waking only to hear the buffeting of the elements. Policemen,
wetter than Ramsgate bathing-men, seeking the
shelter of doorways. The bells of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s unwillingly
giving utterance to their dissatisfaction with their position
by twelve muttering growls. The town, dry in the early
spring, now ankle-deep in mud; the wind is no longer
still, but, stealthily following the unwary foot-passenger,
whirls off his hat, and, stopping for a moment in glee at
his discomfiture, rushes on, eager for more mischief.</p>

<p>Now crowds, freed from their cramped postures in the
playhouse, rush out upon the wild waste of the dripping
Strand.</p>

<p>Here, roaring, fighting, pushing, elbowing each other
into the howling fury of the night. Hither come chattering
voices from the stalls, pit, and recesses of the theatre,
where the chairs remain sole occupants of the place,
and seem to say, “Ah, ha, here we are, snug for the
night!”</p>

<p>Here in the eagerness of regained liberty, they storm
and push each other, while the tempest falls in sheets of
water, and howls above them. On and on in countless
crowds they rush, like human billows. Men and women,
hats, bonnets, and umbrellas, draggled dresses in one
rushing wet mass. Pursuit of cabs, and fruitless return
to the shelter of the passage; savage struggle of humanity
enlivening the black night; little forbearance, but eternal
fighting. On and on they surge, backwards and forwards,
and darker grows the night, fiercer falls the hail, louder
roars the thunder, more clamorous and angry the numberless
voices in the street, when a wild cry goes forth, “A
cab!” Onward it comes, fighting its way through the
elements, the crazy door rattling; onward it comes, now
free as the surging crowd falls back, now overwhelmed in
a sea of human forms. And every voice in the multitude,
answered by storm-voices in the air, shrieks more loudly,
“A cab!”</p>

<p>Still he comes driving on, and at the boldness and determination
of one man the angry crowd rise up, peering over
each other’s heads, and round about the cab they press
upon him, forcing each other down, and starting up and
rushing forward in reckless eagerness.</p>

<p>Round it they surge and roar, and, giving way to others,
moodily depart, still this one fights on bravely….</p>

<p>At last the eager multitude fall back, and dawn of day
discovers the happy occupant within, with the elements
still pouring their fury upon the devoted driver in an
eternity of hail and rain, as on and on he goes into the far
suburbs, with his dim lamps burning, and the fare inside
asleep and snoring, as if there were no tempest trying every
chink and cranny of the shaky vehicle, and no half-drowned
cabby outside with only a moist billycock on his
head, and sleepily yawning so wide that the spirits of the
air, if they could exist on such a night, might look into
the unfathomable depths below.</p>

<p>The first record we have of the Hitquick Club, which
has since assumed a position of proud eminence in the
ball-playing world, is embodied in the following resolution,
which appears in an old minute book, lately disinterred
from the cloisters of Wymbledoune Priory.</p>

<p>“It is proposed by Mr. Pleycynge, and seconded by
Mr. de Vorley,&mdash;</p>

<p>“That this Association has heard read, with feelings of
unmingled satisfaction, the paper communicated by
Verdant Hardcourt Hitquick, Esq., A.E.L.T.C.,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span>
P.H.C.,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span> etc., etc., entitled, ‘Speculations on the origin of
ball-playing, with some observations on the theory of the
back-hander, and the parabola of the lob;’ and that this
Association returns its warmest thanks for the same.”</p>

<p>It further appears that an amendment was suggested by
Will. O’Bye Wisp, Esq., who had failed as a ball-player,
and was better known as an enthusiastic Pyramidalist,&mdash;</p>

<p>“That the study of the triangular must inevitably
result in greater benefits to the human race than the consideration
of the sphere;” but, as this was unsupported by
any further argument than that the triangle had more point
than the ball, the original resolution was carried, Mr. Will.
O’Bye Wisp alone dissenting.</p>

<p>It was further agreed, that V. H. Hitquick, Esq.,
should be President; that he, with Mr. Cutman, Mr.
Shortgrass, and Mr. de Vorley, should be the Committee;
and that Mr. Pleycynge should be the Secretary.</p>

<p>“A casual observer,” adds the Secretary, to whose
notes we are indebted for the following interesting remarks,
“A casual observer might have remarked nothing extraordinary
in the appearance of V. H. Hitquick, Esq.,
during the reading of these resolutions; but to those who
knew that there sat the man who had traced the origin of
the ball into the early ages, when globular masses had been
created by the introduction of the laws of gravity among
shapeless matter; who had detected how, true to the
model of the planetary system, the earliest balls had been
ellipsoidal; how prehistoric men, in their primæval
pastimes, had been driven nigh to frenzy by the false
bounds arising out of this apparently heaven-directed
shape; how, in such times, the advantages of service had
been all preponderating; how certain crafty Chaldean
astrologers in their studies had discovered the shape of the
true sphere, and how, having backed themselves with
wagers of corn and oil and wine, they had cheated in their
international games by substituting the true spheres
when they were being served to, and by using the
ellipsoids when serving; to those, I say, who knew that
there sat the man who had traced out all this and much
else, by the research of half a lifetime, the sight, indeed,
was an interesting one. Mr. Hitquick’s oration in
response was remarkable;” but the damp of the
Wymbledoune cloisters had here much obliterated the
Secretary’s notes. It was gathered, however, that he
was comparing the life of man to that of a tennis-ball,
and was congratulating them “that the philanthropists
and the ball-makers were rapidly, in both cases,
eliminating the seamy side, though he was fain to
acknowledge that some hollowness still remained in
both.” Here the entry becomes illegible, and we have
had to fall back upon tradition, and other sources, for
what we are about to record further of the doings of the
Hitquick Club.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two"><span class="sc lowercase">II.</span></abbr></p>

<p>Mr. Hitquick, who had been delivering over-night,
amidst much applause, an impressive lecture to the members
of the Hitquick Club on various phases of Lawn-tennis
dynamics, was with some difficulty roused from his slumbers
on the particular morning of which it now becomes our duty
to write.</p>

<p><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
“What’s that, Samuel?” he proceeded to say to his
servant, as he sat up in his bed, rubbing his eyes,&mdash;“a
letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then bring me my spectacles,” said Mr. Hitquick.</p>

<p>“If you please, sir, a boy have walked over with this
from Little Mugborough, and he’s a-vaiting below for a
hanswer.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Samuel,” said Mr. Hitquick, as he adjusted
his spectacles and opened the letter. “Why! dear me!
What’s this?”</p>

<p>‘The Secretary of the Little Mugborough Lawn-Tennis
Club presents his compliments to Mr. Hitquick, and begs
to inform him that two members of his Club will be glad to
play any two members of the Hitquick Association at four
o’clock this afternoon.’</p>

<p>“Why! a challenge,” said Mr. Hitquick. “Of course,
we will meet them. Let me see there’s Shortgrass and
Cutman, two active men in the prime of life, who tell me
they generally offer half-thirty in mixed country society; the
very thing. Here, take this, Samuel.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me wery forcibly,” said Samuel to himself
with a wink, “that, if those two gents don’t look a bit
more spry this afternoon than I have ever seen them ven I
have had the extreme privilege of vatching their performances,
the Hitquick Club will have a very considerable
wopping,”&mdash;and, whistling to himself, he went off with
the letter.</p>

<p>Now, it must be confessed that neither Mr. Shortgrass
nor Mr. Cutman were such performers on the Tennis-lawn
as they had led their worthy President, Mr. Hitquick,
to believe, nor as they had described themselves in
their after-dinner conversations, as they sipped the soft
claret for which the Hitquick Club was so deservedly
famous; though certain papers which they had read before
the members of the Association had, no doubt, stamped
them as theoretical professors of no mean order.</p>

<p>Notably, a paper by Mr. Cutman on “Atmospheric
resistance to the Cutman service in the latitude of Greenwich”
(a lecture suggested by certain accurate memoranda,
prepared by the statist of the Club, to the effect that
only ’17 of these services so far overcame it as to pass
over the net), had placed him in the front ranks of Lawn-tennis
theorists; while a lecture by Mr. Shortgrass, on
“Suspected tidal attraction on the Shortgrass lob”
(accounting for the discovery by the same scientific
observer that it almost always completed its parabola on
Mr. Shortgrass’s side of the net), had brought him, too,
into a leading position amongst spheric scientists.</p>

<p>At four o’clock, however, Mr. Shortgrass and Mr. Cutman
stepped upon the lawn, prepared to do battle for the
Hitquickians, and were soon confronted by the team from
Little Mugborough.</p>

<p>The game began, A sharp service was sent to Mr.
Shortgrass, who shut his eyes, hit wildly, and returned it
accidentally. No one’s astonishment was greater than his
own; he felt he had done enough; he shouted “yours”
to balls which kept striking him on head, stomach, and
legs, and did not appear to recover from his intense surprise
till the umpire called, “Set the first, six games to
love, Little Mugborough wins.”</p>

<p>“Call that placing, Samivel, my boy,” said a stout
elderly gentleman, of horsey dress, to his son, who was no
other than Mr. Hitquick’s servant; “call that placing?
Vy! I should like to see one of these ere ball-placers as
could <em>flick</em> a fly off a leader’s ear! That’s wot I calls
placing, Samivel.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hitquick’s face had now begun to lengthen to such
an extent as to cause a bystander to inform him that a
curious compound of brandy and soda-water was to be
obtained in the marquee close by, whither Mr. Hitquick,
taking such bystander’s advice now adjourned.</p>

<p>“Capital game&mdash;smart sport&mdash;rare exercise&mdash;very,”
were the words that fell upon Mr. Hitquick’s ear as he
entered the marquee.</p>

<p>“What! Jangle?” said he, recognising an old
acquaintance, “What brings you here?”</p>

<p>“ Me here&mdash;Wymbledoune Arms&mdash;met a party&mdash;capital
fellows&mdash;gin and water&mdash;Lawn-tennis&mdash;great match&mdash;Little
Mugborough&mdash;came on here&mdash;and here we are.
What name? Know your face.”</p>

<p>“My name, sir, is Hitquick, author of a ‘Treatise on
Balls;’ at your service, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Hitquick&mdash;much pleasure&mdash;great man&mdash;good
book&mdash;read it myself&mdash;Spheric lore&mdash;Sun, Saturn&mdash;Earth&mdash;Jupiter&mdash;pumpkins&mdash;balls&mdash;inter-threaded&mdash;human
race&mdash;round games&mdash;round robins&mdash;general idea&mdash;deuced
clever.”</p>

<p>“And do you&mdash;er&mdash;join, Mr. Jangle, in this&mdash;er&mdash;healthgiving
pastime?”</p>

<p>“Play, Sir,” said Jangle&mdash;“I think I did&mdash;never
heard?&mdash;queer thing&mdash;deuced strange&mdash;great traveller&mdash;round
the world&mdash;visited Madagascar&mdash;met a stranger&mdash;said
he could play&mdash;offered to play him&mdash;gave fifteen&mdash;thermometer
110 degrees in the shade&mdash;threw in a
bisque&mdash;beat him hollow&mdash;no umpire&mdash;stranger riled&mdash;disputed
scoring&mdash;they always do&mdash;ex-champion&mdash;name
Shadow&mdash;all love-sets&mdash;play? rather.”</p>

<p>As Jangle and Mr. Hitquick reapproached the game,
it had just become the duty of the umpire to cry: “Three
sets to love, Little Mugborough wins,” thus deciding the
match adversely to the Hitquickians. Mr. Hitquick
retired a few paces from the bystanders, and, beckoning
Shortgrass to approach, fixed a keen and searching
glance upon him, and uttered in a low tone these
remarkable <span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Sir, you’re a humbug.”</p>

<p>Turning to Cutman, who was trying to conceal himself
behind his late partner, he added,&mdash;</p>

<p>“And you, too, sir.”</p>

<p>“What?” they both exclaimed, starting.</p>

<p>“Humbugs, sir. I will speak more plainly, if you
desire it. Imposters, sir. Yes; imposters.”</p>

<p>And with these words Mr. Hitquick turned slowly on
his heel, and proceeded to rejoin his friends.</p>

<p>This Parody originally appeared in <cite>Pastime</cite>, July 20,
1883. It was afterwards reprinted in <cite>Tennis Cuts and
Quips</cite>, an amusing volume ably edited by Mr. Julian
Marshall, and published by Field and Tuer, London.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The late Mr. Charles Stuart Calverley, the author of
many clever parodies, was a diligent student of the works
of Dickens, and when he entered at Christ’s College,
Cambridge, in October 1852, it was generally admitted
that he was more familiar with the Pickwick Papers than
any other man in the University. Hence arose the jocular
notion of having a competitive examination on that work,
and Calverley drew up an ingenious syllabus of questions,
from which it may be gathered how accurate and minute
was his acquaintance with Pickwick. The examination
was open to all members of Christ’s College, the first
prize was taken by Mr. Walter Besant, and the second by
Mr. (now Professor) Skeat, two gentlemen whose names
have since become familiar in the literary world. The
Pickwick Examination Paper will be found in <cite>Fly Leaves</cite>,
by C. S. Calverley, published by G. Bell &amp; Sons, a few
specimen questions will show the humour of the <span class="lock">thing:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Mention any occasions on which it is specified that
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
the Fat Boy was <em>not</em> asleep; and that (1) Mr. Pickwick
and (2) Mr. Weller, senr., ran. Deduce from expressions
used on one occasion Mr. Pickwick’s maximum of speed.</p>

<p>2. Translate into coherent English, adding a note
wherever a word, a construction, or an allusion requires
it:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Go on, Jemmy&mdash;like black-eyed Susan&mdash;all in the
Downs”&mdash;“Smart chap that cabman&mdash;handled
his fives well&mdash;but if I’d been your friend in the
green jemmy&mdash;punch his head&mdash;pig’s whisper&mdash;pieman,
too.”</p>

<p class="unindent">Elucidate the expression, “the Spanish Traveller,” and
the “narcotic bedstead.”</p>

<p>4. What operation was performed on Tom Smart’s
chair? Who little thinks that in which pocket, of what
garment, in where, he has left what, entreating him to
return to whom, with how many what, and all how big?</p>

<p>5. Give, approximately, the height of Mr. Dubbley;
and, accurately, the Christian names of Mr. Grummer,
Mrs. Raddle, and the Fat Boy; also the surname of the
Zephyr.</p>

<p>8. Give in full Samuel Weller’s first compliment to
Mary, and his father’s critique upon the same young lady.
What church was on the valentine that first attracted
Mr. Samuel’s eye in the shop?</p>

<p>11. On finding his principal in the pound, Mr. Weller
and the town-beadle varied directly. Show that the
latter was ultimately eliminated, and state the number of
rounds in the square which is not described.</p>

<p>12. “Any think for air and exercise; as the wery old
donkey observed ven they voke him up from his deathbed
to carry ten gen’lmen to Greenwich in a tax-cart.” Illustrate
this by stating any remark recorded in the Pickwick
Papers to have been made by a (previously) dumb animal,
with the circumstances under which he made it.</p>

<p>15. Describe Weller’s Method of “gently indicating
his presence” to the young lady in the garden; and the
Form of Salutation usual among the coachmen of the
period.</p>

<p>20. Write down the chorus to each verse of Mr. S.
Weller’s song, and a sketch of the mottle-faced man’s
excursus on it. Is there any ground for conjecturing that
he (Sam) had more brothers than one?</p>

<p>23. “She’s a swelling visibly.” When did the same
phenomenon occur again, and what fluid caused the pressure
on the body in the latter case?</p>

<p>24. How did Mr. Weller, senior, define the Funds, and
what view did he take of Reduced Consols? in what
terms is his elastic force described, when he assaulted
Mr. Stiggins at the meeting? Write down the name of
the meeting?</p>

<p>30. Who, besides Mr. Pickwick, is recorded to have
worn gaiters?</p>

<p>In connection with this examination reference may be
made to the “Death of Mr. Pickwick,” by Messrs. W.
Besant and J. Rice in “The Case of Mr. Lucraft, and
other Tales.”</p>

<p>Night! Night and a thick darkness on the dreaming
city. It was o’er all&mdash;that pitchy veil&mdash;o’er lone deserted
streets and broad suburban roads, along which wagons
with their great clamped wheels jolt forward to the early
market&mdash;o’er square and terrace, and stately dome and
carved pinnacle&mdash;a deep dense obscurity, into which
tower and steeple rose and were lost to the eyes of the
gazer from below!</p>

<p>Night! black, stormy, dreary night. Driving in long
dim lines athwart the starless sky&mdash;lashing the sloping
roofs of dripping houses&mdash;flooding kennel and gutter
and choked-up drain&mdash;pattering like a loud chorus of
rolling spectre drums at rattling windows and on
streaming sky-lights&mdash;down&mdash;in one steady, uninterrupted,
continuous pour&mdash;drove the wild storm of lashing
hail and rain! A dismal night! A night for the well-housed
to snoozle themselves up beneath the bed-clothes,
and listen all crouchingly to the roaring of the tempest!
A night for the homeless pauper to lie down on the lee
side of hedge and stack&mdash;and stretching his stiffening
limbs in the icy sludge, wait patiently until Death came
by and touched him with its sceptre!</p>

<p>Night&mdash;a dreary, dismal, rainy, windy night! A night
of unchained gale and unbridled hurricane! How the
fierce wind roared, to be sure! How it roared in its
wrath, and muttered in its sulkiness, and sung in its glee,
and howled and shrieked and whistled and raved in the
full swing of its fury. It was a jubilee&mdash;be certain of it&mdash;a
time of jubilee with the Wind!&mdash;a night when it had
full license and authority, and power and sanction, to do
its best and its worst&mdash;by sea and by land&mdash;above and
below. And did not the fierce wind avail itself of the
opportunity? Did it not muster its forces, and its
energies, and its powers, far up amongst the dim-driving
clouds, preparing for the onset&mdash;preparing for its night
of empire and of pillage and of mischief? And then,
when its time of liberty came, did it not burst out with a
roar, and a shout, and a clang, as of victorious trumpets&mdash;did
it not career all madly over land and sea, beating
down the weak and broken corn, and roaring over the
stark brown moors, and catching the big leafy limbs of
gnarled trees&mdash;gnarled old mighty trees which had stood
there for centuries&mdash;and wrenching them all torn and
riven and splintered from the groaning trunks, and then
grappling and wrestling with them as strong men fight,
until the victorious wind, with a loud shriek of triumph,
would drag the huge branch out, and toss it
contemptuously away!</p>

<p>Who&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;op! for the Battle won by the Wind!</p>

<p>But that was not all. No, no. It attacked the city
too, as well as the country. It did. The wind!
Coming with a sweep and a pounce and a roar and a
whistle-shrieking up through empty streets&mdash;groaning
with a hollow sound in dim big archways&mdash;catching as
with a muscular grasp, vanes and weathercocks&mdash;coming
to the outside of windows&mdash;laying hold of the glazed
sashes&mdash;shaking and rattling them and shouting hoarse
mad greeting to the people within&mdash;lingering, I say, an
instant at such places, and then departing with a burst
of uproarious joy to lay siege to some high old tottering
ricketty gable, which it would so shake, and push, and
pull, and cause to waver and quake&mdash;that the whole
crazy old tenement to which it belonged would wheeze
and creak and groan in sympathy, until the old men and
the old women, who dwelt there for long years, would be
terrified and frightened, and would cower down upon the
hot hearths or in their beds, crying&mdash;“Woe is me, but
this is a wild night!”</p>

<p>And it was&mdash;it was&mdash;a wild night.&mdash;Who&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;op
for the Battle won by the Wind!</p>

<p>On a bridge which spans a black, swollen, mightily
rushing river. Dim lights twinkle along its great massive,
girding, granite parapets. The wind sweeps over it, and
roars in the arches below, and catches up the bright
foam from the water, and rushes along with it, scattering
the spray in white handfuls aloft, so that the passenger
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
who looks into the gulf from between the balustrades of
carven stone which fence the footpath, shrinks to see the
driving masses of blurred whiteness&mdash;the vexed surface
of the waters torn up and carried along by the strong
broad hands of the blast!</p>

<p>Where a flickering lamp flashed and paled, and rose
and fell within the streaming and storm-lashed crystal of
its dripping prison, stood a woman&mdash;a woman, beautiful
and alone. Black clusters of rain-drenched hair waved
and streamed from her pale cheeks. Her garments were
mean and sodden, and saturated with the storm; but her
eye was bright and fierce, and burning with a fire not of
this world&mdash;with a fire which once&mdash;when the western
heaven opened, and the forked lightning leaped out into
the darkness&mdash;confronted the fierce blaze&mdash;and gave it
back glare for glare!</p>

<p>She stood beneath the flickering lamp. For a moment
only. The next she was erect upon the parapet&mdash;her
arms extended&mdash;her drapery streaming free&mdash;like a bird
that preens its plumage for a new flight&mdash;a flight into
another world?</p>

<p>Ha!&mdash;a voice! Yes&mdash;the woman’s&mdash;hark!</p>

<p>What says it? The words&mdash;the last words&mdash;have
gone forth; and as the dark form disappears from its
granite resting-place&mdash;disappears into the black, howling,
lashing gulf beneath&mdash;these words ring up and away into
the air&mdash;being carried on the wings of the tempest
whithersoever it will&mdash;these awful <span class="lock">words&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Who&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;op for the Battle won by the Wind!”</p>

<p>Yes, yes&mdash;the wind of Passion&mdash;the breath of hopeless,
homeless, heartless, Despair!</p>

<p>Amongst the <cite>Sensation Novels</cite>, so skilfully condensed
by Bret Harte, is a humourous parody of
the most popular of Charles Dickens’s Christmas
books. In it the leading characteristics and
failings are admirably hit off, not only of Dickens,
but also of Scott, Charles Lever, Marryat, Fennimore
Cooper, Hawthorne, and Thackeray, as will
be seen from the following <span class="lock">extracts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">THE FIRST PHANTOM.</p>

<p>Don’t tell me that it wasn’t a knocker. I had seen it often
enough, and I ought to know. So ought the three o’clock
beer, in dirty highlows, swinging himself over the railing,
or executing a demoniacal jig upon the doorstep; so ought
the butcher, although butchers as a general thing are
scornful of such trifles; so ought the postman, to whom
knockers of the most extravagant description were merely
human weaknesses, that were to be pitied and used. And
so ought, for the matter of that, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>But then it was <em>such</em>, a knocker. A wild, extravagant,
and utterly incomprehensible knocker. A knocker so mysterious
and suspicious that Policeman X 37, first coming
upon it, felt inclined to take it instantly in custody, but
compromised with his professional instincts by sharply and
sternly noting it with an eye that admitted of no nonsense,
but confidently expected to detect its secret yet. An ugly
knocker; a knocker with a hard, human face, that was a
type of the harder human face within. A human face that
held between its teeth a brazen rod. So hereafter in the
mysterious future should be held, etc., etc.</p>

<p>But if the knocker had a fierce human aspect in the
glare of day, you should have seen it at night, when it
peered out of the gathering shadows and suggested an
ambushed figure; when the light of the street lamps fell
upon it, and wrought a play of sinister expression in its
hard outlines; when it seemed to wink meaningly at a
shrouded figure who, as the night fell darkly, crept up the
steps and passed into the mysterious house; when the
swinging door disclosed a black passage into which the
figure seemed to lose itself and become a part of the mysterious
gloom; when the night grew boisterous and the
fierce wind made furious charges at the knocker, as if to
wrench it off and carry it away in triumph. Such a night
as this.</p>

<p>It was a wild and pitiless wind. A wind that had commenced
life as a gentle country zephyr, but wandering
through manufacturing towns had become demoralised, and
reaching the city had plunged into extravagant dissipation
and wild excesses. A roystering wind that indulged in
Bacchanalian shouts on the street corners, that knocked off
the hats from the heads of helpless passengers, and then
fulfilled its duties by speeding away, like all young prodigals&mdash;to
sea.</p>

<p>He sat alone in a gloomy library listening to the wind
that roared in the chimney. Around him novels and storybooks
were strewn thickly; in his lap he held one with its
pages freshly cut, and turned the leaves wearily until his
eyes rested upon a portrait in its frontispiece. And as the
wind howled the more fiercely, and the darkness without
fell blacker, a strange and fateful likeness to that portrait
appeared above his chair and leaned upon his shoulder.
The Haunted Man gazed at the portrait and sighed. The
figure gazed at the portrait and sighed too.</p>

<p>“Here again?” said the Haunted Man.</p>

<p>“Here again,” it repeated in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Another novel?”</p>

<p>“Another novel.”</p>

<p>“The old story?”</p>

<p>“The old story.”</p>

<p>“I see a child,” said the Haunted Man, gazing from the
pages of the book into the fire&mdash;“a most unnatural child, a
model infant. It is prematurely old and philosophic. It
dies in poverty to slow music. It dies surrounded by luxury
to slow music. It dies with an accompaniment of golden
water and rattling carts to slow music. Previous to its
decease it makes a will; it repeats the Lord’s Prayer, it
kisses the ‘boofer lady.’ That child&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is mine,” said the phantom.</p>

<p>“I see a good woman, undersized. I see several charming
women, but they are all undersized. They are more or
less imbecile and idiotic, but always fascinating and undersized.
They wear coquettish caps and aprons. I observe
that feminine virtue is invariably below the medium height,
and that it is always babyish and infantine. These
women&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Are mine.”</p>

<p>“I see a haughty, proud, and wicked lady. She is tall
and queenly. I remark that all proud and wicked women
are tall and queenly. That woman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is mine,” said the phantom, wringing his hands.</p>

<p>“I see several things continually impending. I observe
that whenever an accident, a murder, or death is about to
happen, there is something in the furniture, in the locality,
in the atmosphere that foreshadows and suggests it years in
advance. I cannot say that in real life I have noticed it&mdash;the
perception of this surprising fact belongs&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pageno">220</span>
“To me!” said the phantom. The Haunted Man
continued, in a despairing tone:</p>

<p>“I see the influence of this in the magazines and daily
papers: I see weak imitators rise up and enfeeble the
world with senseless formula. I am getting tired of it. It
won’t do, Charles! it won’t do!” and the Haunted Man
buried his head in his hands and groaned. The figure
looked down upon him sternly: the portrait in the frontispiece
frowned as he gazed.</p>

<p>“Wretched man,” said the phantom, “and how have
these things affected you?”</p>

<p>“Once I laughed and cried, but then I was younger.
Now, I would forget them if I could.”</p>

<p>“Have then your wish. And take this with you, man
whom I renounce. From this day henceforth you shall
live with those whom I displace. Without forgetting me,
’twill be your lot to walk through life as if we had not met.
But first you shall survey these scenes that henceforth must
be yours. At one to-night prepare to meet the phantom I
have raised. Farewell!”</p>

<p>The sound of its voice seemed to fade away with the
dying wind, and the Haunted Man was alone. But the
firelight flickered gaily, and the light danced on the walls,
making grotesque figures of the furniture.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” said the Haunted Man, rubbing his hands
gleefully; “now for a whiskey punch and a cigar.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Book <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span></p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">THE SECOND PHANTOM.</p>

<p>One! The stroke of the far-off bell had hardly died
before the front door closed with a reverberating clang.
Steps were heard along the passage; the library door swung
open of itself, and the Knocker&mdash;yes, the Knocker&mdash;slowly
strode into the room. The Haunted Man rubbed his eyes&mdash;no!
there could be no mistake about it&mdash;it was the
Knocker’s face, mounted on a misty, almost imperceptible
body. The brazen rod was transferred from its mouth to
its right hand, where it was held like a ghostly truncheon.</p>

<p>“It’s a cold evening,” said the Haunted Man.</p>

<p>“It is,” said the Goblin, in a hard, metallic voice.</p>

<p>“It must be pretty cold out there,” said the Haunted
Man, with vague politeness. “Do you ever&mdash;will you&mdash;take
some hot water and brandy?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Goblin.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d like it cold, by way of change?” continued
the Haunted Man, correcting himself, as he remembered
the peculiar temperature with which the Goblin was
probably familiar.</p>

<p>“Time flies,” said the Goblin coldly. “We have
no leisure for idle talk. Come!” He moved his
ghostly truncheon towards the window, and laid his hand
upon the other’s arm. At his touch the body of the
Haunted Man seemed to become as thin and incorporeal as
that of the Goblin himself, and together they glided out of
the window into the black and blowy night.</p>

<p>In the rapidity of their flight the senses of the Haunted
Man seemed to leave him. At length they stopped
suddenly.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” asked the Goblin.</p>

<p>“I see a battlemented medieval castle. Gallant men in
mail ride over the drawbridge, and kiss their gauntletted
fingers to fair ladies, who wave their lily hands in return. I
see fight and fray and tournament. I hear roaring heralds
bawling the charms of delicate women, and shamelessly proclaiming
their lovers. Stay. I see a Jewess about to leap
from a battlement. I see knightly deeds, violence, rapine,
and a good deal of blood. I’ve seen pretty much the same
at Astley’s.”</p>

<p>“Look again.”</p>

<p>“I see purple moors, glens, masculine women, barelegged
men, priggish bookworms, more violence, physical
excellence, and blood. Always blood&mdash;and the superiority
of physical attainments.”</p>

<p>“And how do you feel now?” said the Goblin.</p>

<p>The Haunted Man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“None the better for being carried back and asked to
sympathise with a barbarous age.”</p>

<p>The Goblin smiled and clutched his arm; they again sped
rapidly through the black night and again halted.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” said the Goblin.</p>

<p>“I see a barrack room, with a mess table, and a group of
intoxicated Celtic officers telling funny stories, and giving
challenges to duel. I see a young Irish gentleman capable of
performing prodigies of valour. I learn incidentally that the
acme of all heroism is the cornetcy of a dragoon regiment.
I hear a good deal of French! No, thank you,” said the
Haunted Man hurriedly, as he stayed the waving hand of
the Goblin, “I would rather <em>not</em> go to the Peninsular, and
don’t care to have a private interview with Napoleon.”</p>

<p>Again the Goblin flew away with the unfortunate man,
and from a strange roaring below them, he judged they were
above the ocean. A ship hove in sight, and the Goblin
stayed its flight, “Look,” he said, squeezing his companion’s
arm.</p>

<p>The Haunted Man yawned. “Don’t you think, Charles,
you’re rather running this thing into the ground? Of
course, it’s very moral and instructive, and all that. But
aint there a little too much pantomime about it! Come
now!”</p>

<p>“Look!” repeated the Goblin, pinching his arm malevolently.
The Haunted Man groaned.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, I see Her Majesty’s ship Arethusa. Of
course I am familiar with her stern First Lieutenant, her
eccentric Captain, her one fascinating, and several mischievous
midshipmen. Of course, I know it’s a splendid thing
to see all this, and not to be sea-sick. Oh, there the young
gentlemen are going to play a trick on the purser. For
God’s sake let us go,” and the unhappy man absolutely
dragged the Goblin away with him.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>The Haunted Man started, and&mdash;woke. The bright sunshine
streamed into the room. The air was sparkling with
frost. He ran joyously to the window and opened it. A
small boy saluted him with “Merry Christmas.” The
Haunted Man instantly gave him a Bank of England note.
“How much like Tiny Tim, Tom and Bobby that boy
looked&mdash;bless my soul, what a genius this Dickens has!”</p>

<p>A knock at the door, and Boots entered.</p>

<p>“Consider your salary doubled instantly. Have you read
<cite>David Copperfield</cite>?”</p>

<p>“Yezzur.”</p>

<p>“Your salary is quadrupled. What do you think of the
<cite>Old Curiosity Shop</cite>?”</p>

<p>The man instantly burst into a torrent of tears, and then
into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>“Enough. Here are five thousand pounds. Open a
porter-house, and call it ‘Our Mutual Friend.’ Huzza! I
feel so happy!” And the Haunted Man danced about the
room.</p>

<p>And so, bathed in the light of that blessed sun, and yet
glowing with the warmth of a good action, the Haunted
Man, haunted no longer, save by those shapes which make
the dreams of children beautiful, reseated himself in his
chair, and finished <cite>Our Mutual Friend</cite>.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock! In the morning! The Easterly
sun came down bright upon busy streets and grimy
thoroughfares, and quiet places in the far off country. It
was eleven o’clock! In the morning! The sun lighted
up city churches and the broad river, and shone into
death chambers, in houses at the doors of which stood
mutes. It was twelve o’clock! Noon! Broad, bright,
unwinking noon! The sun gleamed on many roofs&mdash;and
on market gardens in the suburbs, and on <a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>potato
cans in the streets, and into the counting house of
Dombey and Son.</p>

<p>The clerks worked noiselessly that day&mdash;almost
breathlessly. Many pens scratched on the paper, and
yet no word was spoken. For Carker was there! Carker
the smooth, the oily&mdash;the velvetty&mdash;the sly.</p>

<p>The sun gleamed through the window panes&mdash;it fell
on Carker&mdash;and on Carker’s teeth. And still it gleamed&mdash;still
it sparkled after the glass door had noiselessly
opened, and before Carker was seen standing the form&mdash;the
stately&mdash;cold&mdash;wifeless&mdash;childless form of Mr.
Dombey!</p>

<p>There was a long pause. You could have heard all the
pens going in the outer office. A long pause&mdash;long&mdash;very&mdash;very
long. Carker spoke first, and when he spoke
he seemed all teeth&mdash;white glistening teeth&mdash;like a shark
of smooth tongue and oily address&mdash;accustomed to good
society.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dombey&mdash;I delight to see you&mdash;I feel honoured&mdash;much
honoured&mdash;deeply honoured&mdash;by this visit.”</p>

<p>There was another pause&mdash;longer than the first&mdash;Oh,
yes! much longer! Eight minutes longer!</p>

<p>And Mr. Dombey drew himself up&mdash;up! High!
higher! like the Genie in the Arabian Tales, till it
appeared (to the eye of Perch which eye happened to be
accidentally applied at the keyhole)&mdash;that the top of Mr.
Dombey’s hat had touched&mdash;nay lifted off the roof of the
counting house of Dombey and Son.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Mr. Dombey, and Perch being frightened
fell backwards upon a nail, and the pens in the outer
office stopped.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” said Mr. Dombey&mdash;“here&mdash;come here&mdash;all
of you,&mdash;and learn how to crush a viper.”</p>

<p>The clerks came accordingly&mdash;thronging about the
door&mdash;with white faces and clenched hands&mdash;excepting
Robinson, who was of a merry turn of mind, and who
said audibly “here’s a lark.”</p>

<p>“Thus”&mdash;said Mr. Dombey, “thus it is I crush a
viper.” His wild, big, grey eyes were fixed, yet
flashing,&mdash;his long gaunt form worked and quivered like
a galvanized corpse,&mdash;his face was as the face of a
roasting demon!</p>

<p>Nobody saw anything of Carker but his teeth: yet from
these teeth issued a hissing sound of “now.”</p>

<p>Could it be? It could! It was! Four policemen sprung
from under the table and held four staffs up to Mr.
Dombey’s nose!</p>

<p>“Now,” said the Teeth, “remove that man.”</p>

<p>Dombey stood like a statue carved out of Parian
marble, but dressed in a hat, coat, pantaloons,
wellingtons, and other minor articles of costume. He
waved his hand and the constables fell back.</p>

<p>“Remove me&mdash;remove Dombey from the counting
house of Dombey and Son?”</p>

<p>These were the only words he spoke; then his tongue
clave unto the roof or ceiling of his mouth.</p>

<p>The Teeth spoke not&mdash;but they held up a board, a
white painted board, such as may be seen at the doors of
merchants’ offices. All started. For on the board was
<span class="lock">painted:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CARKER. LATE DOMBEY AND SON.</p>

<p>“Mine”&mdash;hissed the Teeth&mdash;“mine&mdash;all is mine
Dombey! Dombey! you have fallen! Dombey&mdash;you’re a
beggar! Dombey&mdash;here’s a penny for you! Dombey&mdash;move
on!”</p>

<p>A pause. Dombey as motionless as the figure-head
of a stranded ship.</p>

<p>“You left me to manage your business&mdash;you did.&mdash;I
managed it&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;till I made it mine! mine!
ha! ha! Take the penny, Dombey! take it, that’s a good
man, and go! go! go!”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“No”&mdash;was it an echo? More actors on the scene?
Aye. More! more!</p>

<p>The old woman&mdash;the old woman and the handsome
daughter!&mdash;Edith’s counterpart&mdash;Edith in rags&mdash;Edith
an outcast&mdash;Edith&mdash;Edith&mdash;Still&mdash;Still, Edith.</p>

<p>Oh! how the Teeth chattered&mdash;the Teeth&mdash;they did&mdash;as
the lightening of that outcast’s eye flashed&mdash;and the
cataract of that outcast’s hair streamed, and the trumpet
of that outcast’s voice rang and re-echoed in God’s
sunshine!</p>

<p>“Forger&mdash;Felon&mdash;Murderer! Ha! ha! ha! The
hour is come&mdash;it is!”</p>

<p>And the old crone screamed in chorus “Felon!&mdash;it
is!”</p>

<p>And where was Carker?</p>

<p>On the floor in a strong fit. Smitten&mdash;smitten&mdash;in his
pride and his power. Smitten by the voice of the
woman he had ruined&mdash;the woman he had tried to
hang.&mdash;Now it was her turn! It was!</p>

<p>The policemen were gentle and not rough. They
lifted the fallen man and took him away. Perch saw
handcuffs on the manager’s wrists.</p>

<p>Then the counting house was locked up and seals put
upon the doors. A great crowd stood long opposite to
it. In the midst, Mr. Perch found Dombey with Carker’s
penny still in his hand, and so led him away gently and
gave him shelter at Ball’s-pond.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two"><span class="sc lowercase">II.</span></abbr></p>

<p>“Ding-a-dong&mdash;a-ding-dong&mdash;ding-dong-boum.” Joy-bells&mdash;joy&mdash;for
the wedding! the wedding! Ha! And
at the Wooden Midshipman’s! Cap’en Cuttle was
magnificent. He had had his hook polished with black
lead, and looked himself as radiant as his hook&mdash;aye as
radiant as he did, when, undressing the night before old
Sol Gills tumbled into the garret through the skylight.
Where had that old man been! Where&mdash;indeed where?</p>

<p>It was the question Cap’en Cuttle put&mdash;and in these
terms.</p>

<p>“Whereby and awast&mdash;keep her head to the wind, and
when kitched make a note on. Therefore&mdash;if so&mdash;say
so&mdash;what’s in the log? Let dogs delight to bark and
fight&mdash;for which see Dibdin&mdash;therefore&mdash;stand by it is&mdash;and
that steady.”</p>

<p>Thus solemnly adjured Gills spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>“Where I have been&mdash;and what I have been doing”
the old man said “is nothink to nobody.”</p>

<p>Ding-dong-bell&mdash;ding-a-dong&mdash;a-ding-dong! The
wedding at the Wooden Midshipman! It was on the
very day, almost at the very hour that the house of
Dombey and Son was shut up, that the wedding party
left the Wooden Midshipman. And did he not look
happy&mdash;that Wooden Midshipman? A credible person,
a Beadle, avers that the timber face smiled and the
<span class="pageno">222</span>
timber lips shouted a loud “Hooray” in cadence with
those joy-bells which still rung merrily from the grey
towers of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Koweld-without. Aye, and so they rang
when, before the altar, stood Old Gills with a radiant
countenance and flowing tears&mdash;and Captain Cuttle with
a prayer-book in his hand (in order to check the parson
and keep him right) and his silver chronometer hung on
his hook “whereby to see fair play to all&mdash;awast and
belay”&mdash;and Susan Nipper shedding tears indefatigably&mdash;and
Wall’r and Florence.</p>

<p>The sun was in the heavens! But lo! through the
stained glass, amid the saints and angels&mdash;gorgeous on
that chancel window&mdash;fell its blessing light! Walter
Gay and his bride stood hoping in the sun-shine!</p>

<p>“Wilt thou take this woman to be thy wedded wife?”</p>

<p>“Of course&mdash;no&mdash;that is&mdash;oh dear&mdash;dear&mdash;I beg
pardon&mdash;its of no consequence&mdash;none in the least&mdash;don’t
mind me,” ejaculated a voice from a dimly seen pew
beneath the organ.</p>

<p>Thither repaired the Beadle full of wrath&mdash;and found
the unhappy Toots fainting on a hassock. But the Game
Chicken advancing, doubled the Beadle up&mdash;carried off
Mr. Toots&mdash;deposited him in a patent safety, and conducted
him&mdash;for the improvement and development of
his mind, to see three hundred rats killed in five minutes,
by a terrier much famed in Whitechapel.</p>

<p>So the sun had not begun to descend towards the west&mdash;ere
the marriage party left the church, and&mdash;Wall’r
and Florence, now Mr. and Mrs. Gay leading them on&mdash;took
their way towards London-bridge.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CHAPTER <abbr title="Three"><span class="sc lowercase">III.</span></abbr></p>

<p>In a spacious room&mdash;sat Edith! In a spacious room&mdash;richly
furnished&mdash;but dim&mdash;dim&mdash;as her aching soul.
Gorgeous curtains shut out the light&mdash;the blessed light!
It fell on all alike&mdash;that day&mdash;on the infant in his cradle&mdash;on
the dead man in his coffin. On the kennel&mdash;on the
palace&mdash;on Dombey straying away from Ball’s-pond&mdash;on
Perch looking after him fruitlessly (in public houses).
On Mr. and Mrs. Gay, and the Captain and Gills&mdash;all on
the steamer’s deck going to eat the marriage feast at a
pleasant suburban tavern called the Red House,
Battersea&mdash;on Toots in the patent safety&mdash;on Carker
with the teeth, in a cell of Newgate. On all&mdash;on all!
But on Mrs. Dombey. There, there was darkness&mdash;darkness
in the air&mdash;darkness in the soul&mdash;darkness in
the light! Dim&mdash;aching&mdash;lonely&mdash;alone! Alone! but
for her fearful thoughts! Which haunted her! Spectres&mdash;looming
ghastly gray in the gloom! Spectres with rods
and serpents! Gnawing in her soul&mdash;like unblessed
things potent for evil and foul thoughts, and things
accursed of man! Out&mdash;out&mdash;awful shadows!</p>

<p>But she sat there&mdash;rigid&mdash;unmoved. The mortal and
the immortal. Edith and the shadows!</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice arose&mdash;cleaving the darkness&mdash;She
listened&mdash;mechanically.</p>

<p>“A full, true, and particular account of the harrest of
Mister Carker of the ’ouse of Dombey and Son in the
City on three distinct charges hof forgery, perjury, and
murder all for the small charge of one halfpenny.”</p>

<p>She fell on her knees, That erring woman&mdash;on her
knees and her hands were uplifted, and on the bright
face&mdash;tense and passion strung&mdash;played strange awful
thoughts!</p>

<p>The shadows gathered round her!</p>

<p>Her head drooped&mdash;dropped until with a sudden clash
the marble forehead smote the floor.</p>

<p>Still the shadows gathered round her! There was
silence&mdash;but the low deep roar of humanity&mdash;the surges
of the million-peopled city&mdash;spoke voiceless things in the
summer air.</p>

<p>Listen to the music?</p>

<p>The shadows listened!</p>

<p>Edith lay on the floor beneath the music and the
shadows! When the people of the house came, they
found her&mdash;&mdash;asleep!</p>

<p>“Ding-a-dong-a-ding-dong.” The echoes of the joy
bells rung in the ears of the wedding party, even after
they had got by steamer&mdash;as far as Hungerford. They
were still there&mdash;lying close to the wooden pier&mdash;when
there was a great outcry and a confusion, and many
shouts of “He’s in&mdash;he’s in&mdash;a man in the river.” But
the Cap’en was all presence of mind.&mdash;He saw the
struggling form! and clambering down to the water by
the paddle-wheel&mdash;with his hook&mdash;hooked it out. It was
Dombey!</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CHAPTER <abbr title="Four"><span class="sc lowercase">IV.</span></abbr></p>

<p>Walter Gay is now the head of the old city house of
Dombey and Son.</p>

<p>Carker was hanged; and the Charitable Grinder was
transported for picking Joey Bagstock’s pocket on that
melancholy occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. Toots, under the tuition of the Game Chicken, set
up for a sporting character&mdash;took in twelve dozen copies
of <cite>Bell’s Life</cite> every week, and read them all one after the
other.</p>

<p>The old woman and the handsome daughter are
frequent guests at the Mansion House&mdash;where they are
usually charged with breaking from 35 to 89 panes of
glass in the West London Union.</p>

<p>The Game Chicken espoused Mrs. Pipchin, and the
young couple set up a public-house called the “Peruvian
Mines,” where Miss Tox is barmaid.</p>

<p>The Cap’en got a medal from the Humane Society for
saving Dombey. He always carries it on his hook.
Captain Bunsby married Mrs. Macstinger.</p>

<p>As for Dombey, he took to drinking at first&mdash;and then
to being a church-rate martyr. He has since, however,
become a reformed character, and is now a clerk in a
saving’s bank at 18s. a-week. Occasionally, however,
he and Perch have something comfortable together.</p>

<p>And what of Edith&mdash;erring, beauteous, haughty,
impassioned Edith. She, too, was repentant. At first
she officiated as a pew-opener at a very fashionable
chapel. But here she was persecuted by Major Bagstock
and Cousin Feenix&mdash;both of whom used to squeeze her
hand when she showed them into pews. At length she
retired from the world, and now gets up fine linen at
Tooting.</p>

<p>As for Joey B. and Cousin Feenix they challenged
each other with respect to Mrs. Dombey. Neither of
them, however, appeared at the place of mortal combat,
and neither has been seen, nor heard of since.</p>

<p>They coovered poor Stephen Blackpool’s face!</p>

<p>The crowd from the Old Hell Shaft pressed around him.
Mr. Gradgrind ran to look at the sufferer’s face, but in
doing so, he trod on a daisy. He wept: and a hundred
and sixty more of his hairs turned gray. He would tread
on no more daisies!</p>

<p>He was not, however, to be baulked in his humble,
honest purpose of self-reform. As he passed over the
common, a donkey kicked him. It reminded him that
facts were stubborn things: and he had done with facts and
stubbornness. He wept again.</p>

<p>“Rachel, beloved lass, art thou by me?”</p>

<p>“Ay, Stephen; how dost thou feel?”</p>

<p>“Hoomble and happy, lass. I be grateful and thankful.
I be obliged to them as have brought charges o’ robbery
agin me; an’ I hope as them as did it will be happy an’
enjoy the fruits. I do only look on my being pitched down
that theer shaft, and having all my bones broke, as a mercy
and a providence, and God bless ev’rybody!”</p>

<p>“Stephen, your head be a wandering.”</p>

<p>“Ay, lass; awlus a muddle.”</p>

<p>“Will you take anything, Stephen?”</p>

<p>“I do hoombly thank thee for a good and trew lass thou
hast awlus been to me; and I dunnot care if I do take a
little soomut warm&mdash;wi’ a little sugar.”</p>

<p>The sobered man had still credit at the neighbouring
tavern. In two seconds he appeared with a steaming glass
of rum-and-water, scarcely stopping to sip it by the way.</p>

<p>“Can thou drink rum, Stephen?” asked Rachel, taking
the tumbler from the hands of the sobered man for fear of
accidents.</p>

<p>“I do hoombly and kindly thank thee, lass,” said poor
Stephen; “I can drink anything.”</p>

<p>Rachel placed the goblet to his parched and quivering
lips.</p>

<p>There was a moment of breathless silence. Mr. Bounderby
rattled three-and-sixpence in his breeches pocket, and
finding that his ostentation was unnoticed, kicked a little
boy down the Old Hell Shaft. Mr. Gradgrind purchased a
pennyworth of violets from a blue-eyed flower-girl, and true
to his new and trusting creed, accepted two counterfeit
farthings as change for a sovereign without looking at them.
The Whelp glared fiercely at the rum-and-water, and
barked.</p>

<p>Stephen drank it, every drop. Finished. Down to the
dregs. No heel-taps.</p>

<p>“I do hoombly thank thee, Rachel, good and trew lass
as thou hast been to me; but I do feel much better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, here!” Mr. Bounderby blustered forward: “I’m
not going to stand this. If a man suspected of robbing
Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown’s Bank, is to feel ‘much
better,’ I should like to know what’s the use of Old Hell
Shafts. There’s a touch of the gold-spoon game in that;
and I’m up to the gold-spoon game&mdash;rather! And it wont
go down with Josiah Bounderby. Of Coketown. Not
exactly. Here! Where’s a constable?”</p>

<p>There was none. Of course not. There never is, when
wanted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer pressed officiously forward, and
volunteered to take Stephen into custody.</p>

<p>“Shame!” cried the populace.</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay,” said Mr. Bounderby; “I’m a self-made
man, and, having made myself, am not likely to be
ashamed of anything. There, take him along.”</p>

<p>There was a movement, as if for a rescue. The sobered
man had been sober quite long enough without a fight, and
tucked up his sleeves.</p>

<p>Stephen prevented this explosion.</p>

<p>“Noa, lads,” he said, in his meek broken voice;
“dunnot try to resky me. I be fond o’ constables. I like
going to prison. As for hard labour, I ha’ been used to
that long enough. Wi’ regard to law&mdash;it’s awlus a
muddle.”</p>

<p>“Off with him!” said Mr. Bounderby. “When I used
to commit robberies, I never had any rum-and-water given
to me. No, nor didn’t talk about muddles. And I’m worth
sixty thousand pounds, and have got ladies of family&mdash;ladies
of family;”&mdash;he raised his voice to call attention to
Mrs. Sparsit, who was ambling gently along with the submissive
Stephen on her august shoulders&mdash;“acting as beasts
of burden for me. Come up, madam!” and he gave Mrs.
Sparsit a gentle touch of his whip, causing that high-nosed
lady to prance a little.</p>

<p>They moved on, towards Coketown. The lights were
beginning to blink through the fog. Like winking. The
seven o’clock bells were ringing. Like one o’clock. Suddenly
the tramp of horses and the fierce barking of a dog
were heard.</p>

<p>With a wild cry, Sissy recognised Sleary’s company
galloping towards them&mdash;all mounted; Mr. Sleary himself,
grown much stouter, on his wonderful trained Arab steed,
Bolivar; J. W. B. Childers, who had apparently not had
time to change his dress, as the Indian warrior on the celebrated
spotted Pegasus of the Caucasus; Kidderminster
following, on the comic performing donkey, Jerusalem.</p>

<p>A dog, far in advance of the horse-riders, dashed amongst
the astonished crowd, and singling out Mr. Bounderby,
seized him by the scruff of the neck.</p>

<p>“Thath wight, Mewwylegth,” cried Mr. S., coming up
panting (in addition to his former lisp, advancing age had
afflicted him with a difficulty in pronouncing his <em>r’s</em>).
“Thath the vewy identical cove: pin him! Good dog!”</p>

<p>“Help! murder!” cried the bully of humility, struggling
with the animal. “Will you see a man worth sixty
thousand pounds devoured by a dog?”</p>

<p>The prospect seemed to afford the bystanders considerable
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Ith no uthe, Thquire,” said Sleary, calmly; “the dog
wont let go hith hold of you;” and he added, in a hissing
voice, “<cite>ith Jupeth dog</cite>!”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie,” Bounderby faltered; “I didn’t murder him&mdash;he
did it himself. I never saw the man. He hit me
first. I never spoke to a clown in my life. Tear this
hound off.”</p>

<p>“Quite enough, Thquire,” said Sleary. “I call on
everybody in the Queenth name to athitht me in arethting
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
thith man, Jothiah Bounderby, for the murder of my clown,
Jupe, thickthteen yearth ago.”</p>

<p>Sissy fainted into the Whelp’s arms. From that moment
the latter quadruped resolved to lead a virtuous life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer, with the alacrity of timeservers,
released Stephen, and seized on their former patron.
Stephen slipped quietly away in the confusion of the
moment, remarking, with a wink of satisfaction to Rachel,
“Awlus a muddle!”</p>

<p>Merrylegs retained his hold on his victim’s throat. Like
a vice.</p>

<p>“Murder!” cried Bounderby! “release me from this dog,
or demon, and I will confess all.”</p>

<p>“Mewwylegth, come here, thir!”</p>

<p>Merrylegs released his victim.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the detected miscreant, desperately&mdash;“sixteen
years ago I murdered the man, Jupe, to obtain
possession of eighteen-pence, with which I entered Coketown,
and set up in business. And now, do your worst.”</p>

<p>The crowd recoiled in horror. The sobered man picked
up Mr. Bounderby’s hat, that had dropped off in the scuffle,
and immediately pawned it.</p>

<p>“Off with him!” cried Sleary, in a tone of theatrical
authority,&mdash;“to jail!”</p>

<p>To jail! to jail! to jail!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Political “Mrs. Gummidge.”</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>A “Dickens” of a Situation.</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Gummidge-Gladstone had been in a low state for
some time, and had almost burst into tears when a chill
gust from the North, coming suddenly, and&mdash;to her&mdash;unexpectedly
down the chimney, had blown the lid off the
bubbling saucepan, and the soot into the stew therein.</p>

<p>“I am a much-crossed cretur’,” were Mrs. Gummidge’s
words, when that unpleasant occurrence took place, “and
everythink goes contrairy with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll soon leave off,” said Mr. Peggotty-Bull&mdash;meaning
the North wind,&mdash;“and besides, you know, it’s not
more disagreeable to you than it is to us.”</p>

<p>“I feel it more,” said Mrs. Gummidge-Gladstone.</p>

<p>It was indeed a very cold, cheerless day, with cutting
blasts of wind, which seemed to blow from every quarter at
once, but from the North and East for choice, Mrs. Gummidge’s
peculiar corner of the fireside seemed&mdash;to her at
least&mdash;to be the chilliest and most uncomfortable, as her seat
was certainly the hardest. She complained of the North-Easter,
and of its visitation just at this time and <em>at her back</em>,
which she said gave her the “creeps.”</p>

<p>“It is certainly very uncomfortable,” said Mr. Peggotty-Bull.
“Everybody must feel it so.”</p>

<p>“I feel it more than other people,” said Mrs. Gummidge.</p>

<p>So at dinner. The fish&mdash;from which she had expected
great things&mdash;were small and bony, and the stew was
smoky and burnt. All acknowledged that they felt this
something of a disappointment, but Mrs. Gummidge said she
felt it more than they did, and again made that former
declaration with great bitterness&mdash;“I’m a much-crossed
cretur’, and every think goes contrairy with me.”</p>

<p>Later, when Mr. Peggotty-Bull came home to tea, this
unfortunate Mrs. Gummidge-Gladstone was knitting in her
corner, in a very wretched and miserable condition. Her
knitting&mdash;a nondescript piece of work&mdash;seemed to be a
regular Egyptian labyrinth for complicated tangle, and a
very Penelope’s web for inconclusiveness and power of alternate
weaving and unweaving. “Cheer up, Grand Mawther!”
cried Mr. Peggotty-Bull. (Mr. Peggotty meant Grand Old
Girl.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up.
She dropped her knitting with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>“What’s amiss, Dame?” said Mr. Peggotty-Bull.</p>

<p>“Everythink!” returned Mrs. Gummidge. “Including
<em>you</em>,” she continued, dolefully. “You’ve a willing mind to
face the troubles before you, but you ain’t ready. I’m sorry
it should be along o’ me that you’re so unready.”</p>

<p>“Along o’ you? It ain’t along o’ you!” said Mr.
Peggotty, good naturedly, and perhaps without <em>quite</em> meaning
it. “Don’t ye believe a bit on it,”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it is!” cried Mrs. Gummidge-Gladstone.
“I know what I am. I know that I am a much-crossed
cretur’, and not only that everythink goes contrairy with me,
but that I go contrairy with everybody. Yes, yes. I feel
more than other people do, and I show it more. It’s my
misfortun.”</p>

<p>One really couldn’t help thinking that the misfortune extended
to some other Members of that House, besides Mrs.
Gummidge.</p>

<p>“I ain’t what I could wish myself to be,” said Mrs.
Gummidge. “I am far from it. I know what I am. My
troubles has made me contrairy. I feel my troubles, and
they makes me contrairy. I wish I didn’t feel them, but I
do. I wish I could be harden’d to ’em, but I ain’t. If I felt
less, I could do more. I make the House uncomfortable.
I don’t wonder at it. It’s far from right that I should do it.
I’d better leave the House. I’m a much-crossed cretur’, and
had better not make myself contrairy here. If thinks must go
contrairy with me, and I must go contrairy myself, let me go
contrairy alone at my own place. I’d better leave the
House, and retire and be a riddance.”</p>

<p>Mr. Peggotty-Bull, whose countenance had exhibited the
mixed traces of many feelings, including puzzlement,
impatience, and profound sympathy, looked upward at a
portrait of an ancient, but buck-like and somewhat Hebraic
personage upon the wall, and, shaking his head, with a
lively expression of those mixed sentiments still animating
his face, said, in a solemn whisper,</p>

<p>“She’s been thinking of the Old ’Un!”</p>

<p>This parody of “David Copperfield” appeared
in <cite>Punch</cite> May 2, 1885, it was illustrated
by an excellent cartoon of Mr. Gladstone as
“Mrs. Gummidge.”</p>

his writings and those of Dickens, but is bold enough
to assert that he, and not Dickens, is the original
“Simon Pure.” “A little tale of mine, the <cite>Three

Boz’s ‘Christmas Carol,’ yet the Carol was not published

O’Keefe, although it is generally attributed to Mr.

<p class="p2 center muchlarger">Plays founded upon the
Novels of Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>As is well known Charles Dickens strongly
objected to his Novels being adapted for the
Stage, yet scarcely one of his better known
works escaped that penalty of popularity. As
most of these stage adaptations are little better
than parodies, or imitations, a catalogue of them
may be fitly inserted here.</p>

<p>In this compilation some assistance has been derived
from the life of Dickens, by Mr. F. T. Marzials, (London,
Walter Scott, 1887), but the following list contains more
entries, and fuller details than he gave. It is, in fact, the
only approximately complete list of plays founded on
Dickens’s Works, giving the date and place where first
performed, and the names of the publishers, where they
could be ascertained.</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>Sam Weller</cite>, or the Pickwickians, a Drama in three acts,
first performed at the Strand New Theatre, London,
July 17, 1837. By W. T. Moncrieff. (Dicks 541.)
This has a long preface, in which the author defends
himself against the charge of having merely transferred
Dickens’s characters and incidents from the story to a
play. He says, indeed, that he thinks Dickens ought to
be grateful to him, for the popularity of the play had
greatly extended the fame of the story.</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>The Pickwickians</cite>; or, the Peregrinations of Sam Weller.
Arranged from Mr. W. T. Moncrieff’s adaptation by T.
H. Lacy. London. 1837. (Lacy 315.)</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>The Pickwick Club.</cite> A Burletta in three acts, by E. Stirling.
City of London Theatre, April 27, 1837. (Duncombe.)</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>The Peregrinations of Pickwick</cite>, an acting Drama. By
William Leman Rede. London, W. Strange. 1837.</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>Bardell v. Pickwick</cite>: versified and diversified. Songs and
choruses. Words by T. H. Gem. Leamington, 1881.</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>The Great Pickwick Case</cite>, arranged as a Comic Operetta.
The words of the songs by Robert Pollitt. Manchester,
Abel Heywood &amp; Son, 1884.</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>Bardell v. Pickwick.</cite> (Dicks 636.)</p>

<p class="hangingleft">Last of the Pickwickiana comes Mr. F. C. Burnand’s dramatic
Cantata, <cite>Pickwick</cite>, with music by Mr. Edward Solomon,
which was produced at the Comedy Theatre, London,
early in 1889. The parts were thus distributed, Pickwick
by Mr. Arthur Cecil, Mrs. Bardell by Miss Lottie Venne,
and “The Baker” by Mr. Rutland Barrington.</p>

<p>This Cantata has not yet been published.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but that the character of Sam
Weller made the fortune of <cite>The Pickwick Papers</cite> when they
first appeared in monthly parts, and sent the circulation up
from a poor 400 to 40,000. The germ of this character has
been traced back to a play, written by Mr. Samuel Beazley,
entitled “The Boarding House,” and produced at what is
now called the Lyceum Theatre, in 1811. That there is a
slight resemblance in Simon Spatterdash in this play to
Sam Weller cannot be denied, and Dickens may have seen
or read the play, and have been struck with the possibility of
converting the character of Spatterdash into that of his own
immortal Sam.</p>

both could have been produced on the same night at

<p class="p2 center ls">OXFORD COMMEMORATION.</p>

<p>“The Encænia,” or Commemoration of
Founders and Benefactors which took place
in June last, was marked by all the customary
boisterous merriment on the part of the undergraduates.
The ladies were cheered as usual,
whilst marks of disapprobation were addressed
at all persons whose attire presented any
features of singularity. The Vice-Chancellor’s
Latin address was inaudible on account of the
interruptions, many of which were in excessively
bad taste. The Proctors were loudly
hissed, and called upon to retire, and as they
did not attempt to do so, they were requested
to sing a duet.</p>

<p>It is only perhaps in Oxford that such
conduct on the part of educated men, presumably
gentlemen, would be tolerated; as it
was described (in imitation of Carlyle) fifteen
years ago, so it <span class="lock">remains:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“What is Commemoration? Wherefore? Whereunto?
Why? Is it a mere vacuous Inanition, or speck cut out of
this little world, or has it not rather contrariwise some
Meaning, apart from that which is wrapt up in meness and
youness and every-one-else-ness, and two or three more
beside?</p>

<p class="blockquote">Nay, is it not Portentous, Big with Signs, with its show
Sunday, its Dances, its Encænia and what not?</p>

<p class="blockquote">Is it not a time when it is permitted to Man to wriggle
out of the inextricable snares of the Fowler with his
Attorney-logic, and the frothy effervescences of defunct and
buried-in-dusty tomes Antiquity which are nomen-clated
Lectures? And to be Oblivious of these Gehenna-Bailiffs
emissaried by professors in Tailor-craft, Wine-craft, and the
innumerable other crafts and mysteries ranking under the
genus Productive Industry. Aye, and those gaily apparelled
young ladies (Madchen) who confluctuate hither as to a
Focus, or centre of Attraction, though they themselves are
also an Attraction, which is an inextricable mystery of
Involvedness; do not these too teach a lesson to the gawks,
in whose heads is nothing but the Roots of their World
restored Hair, and who imagine that the whole Furniture of
that digesting mechanism, Man, is but a Lay-figure, gifted
indeed, with struttableness and swagger, on which to hang
their Peacock-plumes, fringes, cobwebs, and such.</p>

<p class="blockquote">And there is the Encænia too, with its Chaotic Hubbub
of Tympanum-splitting Noise, Undergraduates Noise, Ticket

<p class="p2 center ls">JOHN RUSKIN.</p>

<p>Let us take a small extract from his notes on
Samuel Prout and William Hunt’s loan
collection of <span class="lock">pictures:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“That little brown-red butterfly [142] … is a piece of real
painting; and it is as good as Titian or anybody else ever did,
and if you can enjoy it you can enjoy Titian and all other
good painters; and if you can’t see anything in <em>it</em> you can’t
see anything in <em>them</em>, and its all affectation and pretence to
say that you care about them. And with this butterfly in
the drawing I put first, please look at the mug and loaf in
the one I have put last of the Hunt series, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 171. The
whole art of painting is in that mug&mdash;as the fisherman’s
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
genius was in the bottle. If you can feel how beautiful it is,
how ethereal, how heathery, and heavenly, as well as to
the uttermost muggy, you have an eye for colour and can
enjoy heather, heaven, and everything else below and
above. If not, you must enjoy what you can contentedly,
but it won’t be painting; and in mugs it will be more the
beer than the crockery, and on the moors rather grouse than
heather.”</p>

<p>For those who have neglected the opportunity
of testing their taste for art on this
butterfly, and on this mug, I would advise a
visit to Venice, to learn whether they can
appreciate Bassano’s hair trunk, as shown in
his grand picture of the Pope Alexander and
the Doge of Venice. It is <em>not</em> Ruskin, but
Mark Twain who thus describes it:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The hair of this trunk is <em>real</em> hair, so to speak, white
in patches, brown in patches. The details are finely
worked out; the repose proper to hair in a recumbent and
inactive condition, is charmingly expressed. There is a
feeling about this part of the work, which lifts it to the
highest altitudes of art; the sense of sordid realism vanishes
away&mdash;one recognizes that there is <em>soul</em> here. View this
trunk as you will, it is a gem, it is a marvel, it is a miracle.
Some of the effects are very daring, approaching even to
the boldest flights of the rococo, the sirocco, and the
Byzantine schools. Yet the master’s hand never falters&mdash;it
moves on, calm, majestic, confident; and, with that art
which conceals art, it finally casts over the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>,
by mysterious methods of its own, a subtle something which
refines, subdues, etherealizes the arid components, and
endues them with the deep charm and gracious witchery of
poesy. Among the art-treasures of Europe there are
pictures which approach the hair trunk&mdash;there are two
which may be said to equal it, possibly&mdash;but there is none
that surpasses it.”</p>

<p>It may be remembered that Professor Buskin during the
Spring addressed a letter to a provincial paper, respecting
the projected new railway for Derbyshire. As he therein
expressed some very strong opinions against the scheme, as
one likely to give the miserable, melancholy, and toiling
millions who dwell in smoke-stifling and unwholesome towns,
an occasional chance of letting a little bright fresh air and
sunlight in upon the gloom of their darkened lives, it is
satisfactory to know that the letter in question is now believed
to have been a clever hoax. At any rate, the zenith
of that boon to millions, the summer excursion season has
produced a second communication to the same journal: and,
as it not only bears the Professor’s signature, but breathes
with the spirit of his larger philanthropy, there can be little
doubt as to its authenticity.</p>

<p>In the course of this second letter, Professor <span class="sc">Buskin</span>
<span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“I do not know how this mental revolution has come
about within me, nor, were you to ask me, could I tell you.
I only recognise the stupendous fact that I feel, and am not
ashamed to avow, that I no longer regard the wild witchery
of the Derbyshire glens as a precious and special property
held by Providence in trust for me and a few exclusive well-to-do
Sybarites for our sole select and selfish delectation.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p class="blockquote">Here it is, this Derbyshire Garden of Eden, with its
magic-lantern-slide effects, lost for ever and for ever to
everyone save to you and to me and the lucky Stall-sitters
who hold, out of the overflowing fulness of their purses, the
front places in the world’s glittering show, to the shifting
and shutting out of the humbler and poorer from the sight
and sense of it.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Follow, if you can, without wetted feet, the floretted
banks and foam-crisped wavelets of the slyly wilful stream.
Into the very heart and depth of this, and politely bending
with the bends of it, your railway introduces its close-clinging
attention. The rocks are not big enough to be tunnelled,
they are cheerily blasted away; the brook is not wide
enough to be bridged, it is comfortably covered in, and is
thence-forward no physical obstacle to an enterprising Railway
Company. I have not said, I leave the clergyman and
physician to say, what moral and sanitary changes follow
a free access to the gifts of Nature. But I may, at least,
advise your correspondent that envenomed air is deadlier to
the young than the old, and that the sooner a completed line
of railway enables the pent-up thousands of pestiferous cities
to figure as three-and-sixpenny excursionists, if only for a few
hours, amidst these hitherto inaccessible fairy haunts, the
sooner will English children who have been reared in mephitic
fume instead of mountain breeze, who have had for playground
heaps of ashes instead of banks of flowers, whose
Christmas holidays brought them no memory, whose Easter
sun no hope, enjoy some of the blessed delight of breezy hillside
and sunlit glen hitherto claimed as the special and
peculiar heirloom of that unreasoning and wrong-headed
class who, singing the sweet song of Nature’s praise, defame
that priceless metal line which, like some mighty wizard,
alone has borne their welcome echo to a myriad aching city
hearts.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">On Toothpicks.</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>By Professor Buskin.</cite></p>

<p>I came the other day quite by chance on this piece of
news in my <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>:&mdash;“It is said that no less than
25 millions of Toothpicks are annually made in England.
This is just one to each person.” “Just one?” No, there
is no justice here, it is all injustice. Think of this&mdash;25
millions, and think further of the 25 millions of Englishmen
who can use them. Yes, this is what England has come to
be&mdash;a nation of Toothpickers; for mark this, each man <em>can</em>
use a toothpick if he will; if he can by fair means or foul
(too often, alas, by foul!) obtain the paltry coin to purchase
the Tooth-pick with.</p>

<p>But then these dilettanti-scribblers, these writers in the
newspapers who are paid for their scribbling, these folk
(forsooth!) say, “what have you to do with this&mdash;this
Toothpicking?” I answer we have all to do with it. For
hear, yea, and forbear with me a minute while I speak to
you of this same Toothpicking.</p>

<p>Friends, it comes to this. Picking is a natural attribute
of man. He must throughout life be a picker. But now
comes the momentous question, a picker of what? A picker
of knowledge, a dabbler in all the ’ologies, an admirable
Crichton, veriest of prigs, or a picker of locks, a red-handed
burglar, a hero of penny novels, or will he be a
picker of teeth, a drawling vacuity weary of himself, weary
of every thing, an inane hanger on to the skirts of the
Universe? Will not the brave man, the wise man, the man
of resolve, of energy, of endurance, a picker of roads, will
he not go forth to beautify Hincksey, to plant the new
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
Utopia, to commence the Era of Æstheticism, and of the
Fors?</p>

<p>Now, turning his picking propensities to some real use,
he will learn to do hard work, to blister his hands, to wheel
barrows, to preach Buskinism.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin is a depressing pessimist, according to whom
nearly everything that was done in England three centuries
or so ago was lovely and true, whilst all nineteenth century
progress is in the wrong direction. “I know of nothing”
he writes “that has been taught the youth of our time
except that their fathers were apes, and their mothers
winkles; that the world began in accident, and will end in
darkness; that honour is a folly, ambition a virtue, charity a
vice, poverty a crime, and rascality the means of all wealth
and the sum of all wisdom.” Now these sweeping
assertions are false, and Mr. Ruskin knows they are false,
he could not advance a tittle of proof that any professor in
modern times had inculcated any such doctrines. Those
who want an antidote to Mr. Ruskin’s views should read
“<cite>Pre-Raffaelitism</cite>; or a Popular enquiry into some newly-asserted
Principles connected with the Philosophy, Poetry,
Religion and Revolution of Art” by the Rev. Edward
Young, M.A. London: Longmans &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, 1857.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Moll Marine</span>:</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc">By</span> “<cite>Weeder</cite>.”)</p>

<p>Moll Marine! A simple, touching name! It had been
bestowed upon her by the rude country hinds among whom
she dwelt. It was all she received at their hands besides
blows and curses. Moll was a common name in those parts,
but none knew what it meant, none discerned the hidden
poetry in that brief monosyllable. Moll Marine they called
her, because she came among them as a waif from the wild
waves, as a white foam fleck that the winds toss on to the
cold rocks to gleam a moment in the setting sun, and then
dissolve for ever into the dews of night.</p>

<p>She was only fifteen, tall and graceful as a young poplar,
with a warm brown skin and a scented wealth of amber
hair. Everybody hated her. “It was natural,” she
thought. They beat her, but she cared not. She was like
a lucifer; they struck her, and she blazed forth resplendent;
beautiful as the spotted panther of the forest, as the shapely
thistle that the ass crops unheeding, as the beaming comet
that shakes out her golden tresses in the soft hush of
summer nights.</p>

<p>And she loved. Loved madly, passionately, hopelessly.</p>

<p>He knew it. He knew that he had but to say, “Come!”
and she would follow him to disgrace or death, to polar
snows or deserts arid as Gehenna. To him she was
nothing. No more than the painted fly he pinned in sport,
than the yellow meadow flowers that he crushed beneath
his heel, than the soft tender doves whose downy necks he
wrung and whose bodies he eat with cruel relish.</p>

as an elegant young patrician redolent of Jockey Club
sauntered past him.</p>

<p>‘I do take it in; also the <cite>Life</cite>,’ said the noble, as he
flicked some dust from his spotless boots, and then he blew
his nose gracefully.</p>

<p>‘O, stow yer larks!’ said the other; but the next moment
he repented using such language; for the apparently
delicate nobleman had carelessly taken him by the seat of
his trousers and thrown him over the rails, as though he had
been a feather, instead of weighing at least 15 stone.</p>

<p>‘Curse him!’ he muttered, as he came back trying to look
pleased. ‘What d’yer want to do, my lord?’ he said, with
a ghastly smile.</p>

<p>Mentioning a horse, the haughty young aristocrat asked
what he would lay against it.</p>

<p>‘Against it?’ said the welcher. ‘Well, it ain’t usual
for us to lay against ’em; but I’ll give yer 4 to 2.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ wearily replied the marquis; ‘in half millions.
I also want to back it for a lady, in gloves.’</p>

<p>‘Wery good, my lord; dogskin or kid?’</p>

<p>This of course could only be meant for insult. The peer
looked at him half amused, half disgusted, and walked listlessly
away.</p>

<p>The welcher scowled after him with bitter hatred; but
just then the bell rang, and he hurried off to see the horses
and jockeys weighed. When he arrived at the shed he
found all ready but one, the jockey who was to ride the
horse he had laid against. He was just sitting down to
dinner.</p>

<p>‘They’re waiting for you,’ said a steward, rushing into
the room.</p>

<p>‘Ask them to wait a little longer; I shall be ready in
forty minutes,’ said the jockey, taking a spoonful of potage
à la Tortue.</p>

<p>The steward rushed out somewhat excitedly.</p>

<p>‘Now’s my time,’ said the welcher, and creeping behind
the light weight he gently unfastened one of his spurs, and
put another in its place. He had scarcely finished when the
referee came in to say that the starter would wait no longer.
Quaffing a large goblet of champagne, the jockey murmured,
‘Che, sara, sara,’ and staggered out. Why did the welcher
look so fiendish. <em>He had fastened on the jockey’s boot a
spur with painted rowels.</em></p>

<p>Following him out, he could just see him galloping down
the course, and hear the people cheer as their favourite went
by in his crimson jacket, with scarlet sash, green hoops,
pink sleeves, and yellow cap. Before he could get to the
starting-box the horses were off; but disdaining to join
them in the middle of the race, and wishing also to exchange
a few compliments with the starter, he rode up to him, and
after relieving his mind, dashed after the others. By the
time he got to the ‘Corner’ he was only two furlongs
behind; at the distance a hundred yards; at the Red House
fifty; and as they passed the Stand he was but a length
from the leaders. He touched his gallant steed with the
spur for a final effort; but instead of leaving the others
behind as usual, it staggered, stopped, and went to sleep.
<em>The laudanum had done its work.</em> Just then his rider heard
a great shout, and looking up saw thousands of arms carrying
the victorious jockey back to the scales. La Merveille
had won the Cambridgeshire.</p>

eager for a ‘go in’ on the scratching Cambridgeshire.</p>

sunlight, is as that of an early Turner sunset gone ineffably
mad.</p>

<p>Three breaks; the flag falls; a glorious start, and away
they go like no end of a line of eager harlequins before their
creditors. ‘Off!’ and Out of Pounds, after taking up the
running, ‘compounded;’ Adamite fell; Sunburn cooled
down; Caxtonian ‘pressed’ onward; Fitz-Pluto ‘warmed’
to his work. ‘<em>Now</em>!’ Blood lashes to fury. The Ring
roars&mdash;‘It’s a skinner!’ And Breadloser, Lord Strive,
Hartington, and Lar Mervilly dash like fiends through the
cold, fresh, wild winter wind, blowing as it might have
done in Stuart times, when Mistress Nell Gwynn, the fat
King’s ‘fancy,’ was here to inhale it.</p>

<p>Hark! ‘The <a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>foremost wins!’ ‘Rob Boy’s a “teaser”!’
‘Mervilly’s lost!’ ‘Flash Man’s a brilliant failure!’</p>

<p>Lost? A palpitating lie!</p>

<p>’Send me a cropper!’ exclaimed Constable, a ‘clipping’
jock who had landed many a mount. ‘Send me a cropper,
if you like, but “plant” me a winner!’</p>

<p>The blue filly answered with lightning spontaneity. Game
to the last, Constable, a great Pickwick in his mouth,
coaxed a final effort out of her. The delirium of pace was
upon him. ‘Go in a perisher!’</p>

<p>On came the trio&mdash;on, until one last convulsive impulse of
the outstretched limbs, and&mdash;hark! The cry has changed.
‘Mervilly wins!’</p>

<p>A thousand jewelled hands hold forth bouquets of hissing
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau de Cologne</i>. And Constable, true to the canons of his
Order, ‘runs her in.’</p>

<p>A cry as of the disappointed, the desperate, or the d&mdash;d,
went out over the ghastly fens; seemed to reel from many a
gallant ‘plunger’ in anticipation of an approaching
‘weigh-in.’ Next to first was Second; Better Last than
Never, whose dominant instinct it was to lose, third.</p>

<p>There was much wisdom after the event. Two minutes
eight seconds! A man on a bicycle might have done it in
less time!</p>

<p>The following very happy burlesque of the
nautical tales in the style of Captain Marryat
and Captain Chamier, was written in 1842 by
the late Professor W. E. Aytoun, who, in conjunction
with Sir Theodore Martin, wrote the

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Flying Dutchman.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>A Tale of the Sea.</i></p>

<p>We were in the midst of the storm-tossed Atlantic. A
heavy simoom, blowing N.E. by S., brought in the huge
tropical billows mast-high from the Gulf of Labrador, and
awoke old ocean, roaring in its fury, from its unfathomable
depths. No moon was visible among the hurricane rack of
the sky&mdash;even the pole-star, sole magnet of the mariner’s
path, was buried in the murky obscurity of the tempest; nor
was it possible to see which way the ship was steering, except
by the long track of livid flames which followed in the wake
of the bow, or when, at times, some huge leviathan leapt up
from the water beside us, and descending with the vehemence
of a rock hurled from heaven, drove up a shower of aquatic
splinters, like a burst of liquid lava from the sea. All the
sails which usually decorated the majestic masts of H.M.S.
Syncope (a real seventy-nine of the old Trafalgar build, teak-built
and copper fastened) were reefed tightly up, with the
exception of the mainsail, the spritsail, the mizzen-boom sail,
and a few others of minor consequence. Everything was
cleared away&mdash;halyards, hencoop, and binnacle had been
taken down below, to prevent accidents; and the whole of
the crew, along with the marines and boarders, piped to their
hammocks. No one remained upon deck except the steersman,
as usual lashed to the helm; Josh Junk, the first
bos’un; and the author of this narrative, who was then a
midshipman on board the vessel, commanded by his uncle,
Commodore Sir Peregrine Pendant.</p>

<p>“Skewer my timbers!” exclaimed Mr. Junk, staggering
from one side of the deck to the other as an enormous wave
struck us on the leeside, and very nearly unshipped the capstan&mdash;“Skewer
my timbers, if this a’n’t enough to put an
admiral’s pipe out! Why, Master Tom, d’ye see, it’s growing
altogether more and more darkerer; and if it a’n’t clearer by
twelve bells, we’ll be obligated to drop anchor, which a’n’t
by no means so pleasant, with a heavy swell like this, running
at nineteen knots an hour in the middle of the wide Atlantic.
How’s her head, boy?”</p>

<p>“North by south it is, sir,” replied the steersman.</p>

<p>“Keep her seven points more to the west, you lubber!
Always get an offing when there’s a wet sheet and a flowing
sea. That’s right, Jem! Hold her hard abaft, and she’ll
go slick before the wind, like a hot knife through a pound of
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
butter. Halloo, Master Tom, are you holding on by the
seat-railings already&mdash;you a’n’t sick, are you? Shall I tell
the steward to fetch a basin?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Josh,” I replied, “’tis nothing&mdash;merely a
temporary qualm. But tell me&mdash;do you really apprehend any
danger? If so, would it not be prudent to call up the commodore,
and hang out the dead-lights?”</p>

<p>“Why, Master Tom,” replied the bos’un, turning his quid,
“them ere’s kevestions as I can’t answer. ’Cos, first&mdash;there’s
no knowing what danger is till it comes; secondly, it’s
as much as my place is worth to disturb old Fire-and-Faggots&mdash;axing
your pardon for the liberty&mdash;afore he’s finished his
grog with the mates below; and, thirdly, it’s no use hanging
out the dead-lights, ’cos we’re entirely out of oil.”</p>

<p>“Gracious heavens!” cried I, “and suppose any other
ship should be in the same latitude?”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the bos’un with all imaginable coolness, “I
reckon it would be a case of bump. Oak varsus teak, as the
law-wers say, and Davy Jones take the weakest.&mdash;But hitch
my trousers! what’s that?”</p>

<p>As the non-commissioned officer spoke, a bright flash was
seen to the seaward immediately ahead of our vessel. It was
too bright, too intense to proceed from any meteoric phenomena,
such as sometimes are witnessed in those tropical
climate, and the sullen report which immediately followed,
indicated too clearly that it proceeded from some vessel in
the vicinity.</p>

<p>“A first-rater, by jingo!” said Mr. Junk, “and in distress.
Hold my telescope, Master Tom, till I go below and turn
out the watch,”&mdash;&mdash;but that instant his course was arrested.</p>

<p>Scarce a second had elapsed after the sound of the discharge
reverberated through our rigging, when, only a
hawser’s distance from our bowsprit, a phosphoric light
seemed to rise from the bosom of the shadowy deep. It
hung upon the hull, the binnacle, the masts, the yards of a
prodigious ship, pierced apparently for three tier of guns,
which, with every sail set, bore down direct upon us. One
moment more and collision was inevitable; but Junk, with
prodigious presence of mind, sprang to the helm, snatched
the wheel from the hands of the petrified steersman, and
luffed with almost supernatural force. Like a well-trained
courser who obeys the rein, our noble ship instantly yielded
to the impulse, and bore up a-lee, whilst the stranger came
hissing up, and shot past us so close that I could distinctly
mark each lineament of the pale countenances of the crew
as they stood clustered upon the rigging, and even read&mdash;so
powerful was that strange, mysterious light&mdash;the words
painted within her sides,&mdash;“<span class="sc">Those who go abaft the
binnacle pay Cabin fare</span>!” On, on she drove&mdash;a
lambent coruscation, cleaving the black billows of the
Atlantic main, about to vanish amidst the deep darkness of
the night.</p>

<p>“That was a near shave, anyhow,” said Mr. Junk, relinquishing
the wheel, “but we must know something more of
that saucy clipper,” and catching up a speaking trumpet, he
hailed,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!”</p>

<p>“Ship yourself!” was the response.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“What’s yours!”</p>

<p>“Syncope&mdash;Britannic Majesty’s seventy-nine&mdash;for
Trinidad.”</p>

<p>“Yung Fraw&mdash;merchant ship, for Rotterdam.”</p>

<p>“What cargo?”</p>

<p>“Soap!” was the reply. “How are YOU off for it?
Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>A peal of diabolic laughter rolled across the deep, mingled
with the rushing of the waves and the whistling of the
winds. Another flash&mdash;another report&mdash;and the meteor
light sunk as noiselessly as it had arisen into the bosom of
the watery surge. At that moment the moon burst out from
behind a cloud, clear and queenlike, illuminating the ocean
for miles. We rushed to the stern and looked back. In
vain! no vestige of a ship was there&mdash;we were alone upon
the warring waters!</p>

<p>“By the Lord Harry!” said the bos’un, dropping the
trumpet&mdash;“as sure as my name’s Josh Junk, that ’ere was
the <span class="sc">Flying Dutchman</span>!”&nbsp;-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-&nbsp;-</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">OUR NEW ACTORS.</p>

<p>Three imitations of Charles Lamb’s essay on
“<cite>Some of our Old Actors</cite>” were published in a
Parody Competition in <cite>The World</cite>, October, 15,
1879. The first prize was awarded to the
<span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Taking up a to-days <cite>Standard</cite>&mdash;I know not by what
freak of fancy I came to purchase one&mdash;I glanced at a
few of the theatrical advertisements, which occupy no inconsiderable
space in its columns. One of these presented the
cast of parts in the <cite>Iron Chest</cite> at the Lyceum Theatre&mdash;Sir
Edward Mortimer, by Henry Irving. What an ambitious
sound it has! How clearly it brings before me the comely
sad face&mdash;thoughtful and therefore sad&mdash;and the almost
painfully-intense manner of the modern actor!</p>

<p>Of all the ‘Sir Edwards’ who have flourished in my
time&mdash;a dismal phrase if taken aright, reader&mdash;that mad
genius, the great little man with the fine Italian face and
flashing eyes, Edmund Kean, is the most unforgetable. That
of Irving comes next. He, since Kean, most fully realises
the author’s idea of the style of man best suited to fill the
part&mdash;‘a man of sable hue, and one in whose soul there’s
something o’er which his melancholy sits and broods.’ But
the secret of Irving’s success lies in his fine annihilation
of self&mdash;a rare quality among players&mdash;combined with an
originality which triumphs over tradition. There is a
marked naturalness about his acting of this character,
bottomed on enthusiasm. Like genius, he seems at times to
have the power of kindling his own fire into any degree of
intensity.</p>

<p>Kean, of whom Mrs. Siddons said, ‘There is too little of
him to do anything;’ but of whom his landlady said, ‘There
is something about Mr. Kean, ma’am, that tells me he will
be a great man;’ Kean, whose exclamation, ‘My God, if I
should succeed now, I think it will drive me mad!’ was
prophetic, and who, <em>when</em> successful, cried, ‘D&mdash; Lord Essex,
Mary; the pit rose at me!’&mdash;Kean tore the passion of the
play to tatters.</p>

<p>Irving’s recenter style does not go to work so grossly.
Seemingly convinced of the facts that whatever is done for
effect will be seen to be done for effect, and that Nature for
ever puts a premium on reality, he interests, as all may, by
being persistently and intensely human. There is a consonancy,
so to speak, which the green probationer in tragedy
spoils by failing to exercise that repression which is an index
of power.</p>

<p>In Hamlet, Mathias, in the remorseful rant of Eugene Aram,
and the rest, Irving has proved himself histrionic to a degree
that will always command intelligent recognition.</p>

<p>All have seen Sothern! What a Dundreary the world
has in him! What witty conceits that pleasant creature has
to trifle an hour or two away!&mdash;he whose ineffable fooling,
if done by another, would partake of the essentially ludicrous.
Then there is my beloved Toole, whose quirks never left a
sting, who drolls inimitably, and whose quality is so irresistible
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">234</span>
that like a sunbeam, he exists but to cheer&mdash;a touching
function, reader. My beloved Toole is, in his walk, in no
way inferior.</p>

<p>Shakespeare foresaw the existence of Miss Ellen Terry
when he created Portia, as Sir Walter might that of Miss
Neilson when he spake in <em>Kenilworth</em>.</p>

<p>There are who say that Barry Sullivan is the leading
legitimate actor of the British stage&mdash;a big distinction,
which few will, perhaps, be disposed to deny him. But the
difference between Sullivan and Irving is, I take it, this:
Sullivan has the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga virilis</i>, and the old and obvious
canons of his art; Irving is an actor less by tradition than
instinct. Sullivan’s rich baritone, with its harmonious and
not-without-skill-delivered periods, stirs the whole house
like the sound of a trumpet: Irving’s shriller pipe is fuller
of Nature’s own rhetoric for a finer few. Sullivan may fill
the theatre; Irving may find an empty seat or two in the
gallery.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">LORD MACAULAY.</h3>

<p><cite>The Quarterly Review</cite>, for April 1868, contained
a review of Lady Trevelyan’s edition of the
works of Lord Macaulay, in which the following
passage was quoted as a specimen of his
<span class="lock">style:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The misgovernment of Charles and James, gross as it had
been, had not prevented the common business of life from
going steadily and prosperously on. While the honour and
independence of the State were sold to a foreign Power,
while chartered rights were invaded, while fundamental laws
were violated, hundreds of thousands of quiet, honest, and
industrious families laboured and traded, ate their meals and
lay down to rest, in comfort and security. Whether Whig
or Tories, Protestants or Jesuits were uppermost, the grazier
drove his beasts to market; the grocer weighed out his
currants; the draper measured out his broadcloth; the hum
of buyers and sellers was as loud as ever in the towns; the
harvest-home was celebrated as joyously as ever in the
hamlets; the cream overflowed the pails of Cheshire; the
apple juice foamed in the presses of Herefordshire; the
piles of crockery glowed in the furnaces of the Trent; and
the barrows of coal rolled fast along the timber railways of
the Tyne.”&mdash;(Vol. iv. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 189.)</p>

<p>There is no reason why this rhetorical diarrhœa
should ever stop so long as there was a
trade, calling, or occupation to be particularised:
the pith of the proposition (which required no
proof) being contained in the first sentence.
Why not continue <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The apothecary vended his drugs as usual; the poulterer
crammed his turkeys; the fishmonger skinned his eels: the
wine-merchant adulterated his port; as many hot-cross buns
as ever were eaten on Good Friday, as many pancakes on
Shrove Tuesday, as many Christmas-pies on Christmas-day;
on area steps the domestic drudge took in her daily
pennyworth of the chalky mixture which Londoners call
milk; through area bars the feline tribe, vigilant as ever,
watched the arrival of the cats’-meat man; the painted
courtesan flaunted in the Haymarket; the cabs rattled
through the Strand; and from the suburban regions of
Fulham and Putney the cart of the market-gardener wended
its slow and midnight way along Piccadilly to deposit its
load of cabbages and turnips in Covent Garden.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Page by Macaulay.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<cite>From the History of the Beadleship of Brown.</cite>)</p>

<p>When Brown grasped the staff of office, he was in need
of the staff of life. Raised at once from want to wealth,
from obscurity to renown, from the practice of submission to
the habit of command, he did his work sternly; but not too
sternly to do it well. The unexpectedly chosen Beadle became
a correspondingly energetic Beadle. The new broom
swept clean. A week had not passed ere abuses were
remedied&mdash;the indolence of one portion of the parish officers
pricked into action&mdash;the disaffection of another crushed into
obedience. A benevolent despotism is the best form of
government&mdash;Brown was despotic, benevolent, and a Beadle.</p>

<p>Let us review the state of affairs as they existed when he
first assumed the cocked hat of office as Beadle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Tomkins. Apple-women usurped the pavement. Piemen
obstructed the roadway. Professed beggars demanded
alms at every door&mdash;impostors exhibited artificial sores at
every corner. What the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles is to the parish
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James, the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tomkins was to the parish of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles. Nuisances of another nature throve also and
waxed great from day to day. The pew opener grumbled;
the turncock muttered to himself; the churchwardens
squabbled, and the rate-payers complained. There was
murmured disaffection in the vestry&mdash;open revolt amongst
the charity boys. It was a time of mutual recrimination&mdash;of
mutual dissatisfaction. Jones abused Smith, Smith
retorted upon Jones. Robinson hated Thomson, Thomson
repaid the compliment with interest to Robinson. There
was an unruly license of tongue, a general saturnalia of
speech. Whispered scandals grew into outspoken charges,
and the malicious reports hatched from the tea and muffins
of old maidish parties were repeated with envenomed aggravations
over the port and sherry of parish dinners. Then it
was that short weights were publicly attributed to Smith,
and a false steelyard confidently asserted to belong to Jones.
Johnson, heated with gin, said that Jackson beat his wife&mdash;Jackson,
inflamed with rum, said that Mrs. Johnson beat her
husband. Charges, counter-charges, insinuations, inuendos,
ran riot. No man looked with complacency on his neighbour;
no husband looked with confidence upon his wife; no
wife looked with respect upon her husband. As yet the
band of Reformers who were shortly to arise was unheard of.
Thomas Styles was but sixteen; John Nookes but thirteen-and-a-half.
The pen of the great Smythe Smithers was yet
employed upon half text. No word indicating his future
destiny had fallen from Tomkin’s lips&mdash;Gubbins had not yet
been born&mdash;Snooks was in long clothes&mdash;and Trother yet
unemancipated from parish leathers.</p>

<p>On Brown then it alone devolved to grapple with the task.
He was the dauntless pioneer of a dauntless army, a champion
destined to show the world that the glitter of a Beadle’s staff
may outshine the splendours of a Marichall’s baton, if it did
not dim the magnificence of a Monarch’s sceptre.</p>

<p class="center">(<cite>From what we “Macaulay” History of our own.</cite>)</p>

<p>The King had been thrown from his horse at Hampton
Court, and was dead. Great were the rejoicings in Paris
and Rome on receipt of the tidings, and the hopes of the
Jacobite party rose; however, the accession of the second
daughter of the last Stuart monarch to the throne as Anna
Regina once more clouded their prospects. Her Court,
adorned by Marlborough (who did not sell his pictures),
Bolingbroke and Swift, would have been as nothing without
the genius of one whose name does not figure in the accepted
histories of that reign, but whose influence at Court not even
the imperious Sarah Jennings, nor her rival, Lady Masham,
nor any of the Whigs or Tories of that distracted period,
could afford to ignore. A peaceful citizen, whose Hair Preparations
gave that graceful brilliancy and tone to the brown
hair of the Sovereign, and whose marvellously manufactured
Wigs adorned the heads of the noblest in the land, was not
one to be lightly passed by, and thus it was Professor
Browne was the ruling spirit at the Court of Queen Anne.
No Wigs could equal his in form, graceful folds, and luxuriant
masses of hair; they covered the heads of the wisest and
best in the land, so that it was no wonder the Professor, who
had long studied the heads of the people, was universally
consulted on all matters of such vital importance. Unfortunately,
however, Prince Eugene of Savoy, who at this
time came over on a secret mission from the Emperor to the
Queen, foolishly declined to pay a visit to Fenchurch Street,
and procured from some opposition hairdresser a short
campaigning Wig in which to appear at Court. The same
evening, the Prince, smoking his cigar at his hotel, happened
to be trying on this new head gear when the Hanoverian
Minister, Baron Hoffman, called, and seeing that neither in
style, make, nor effect was it equal to <span class="sc">Browne’s</span>, endeavoured
to induce the Prince, but in vain, to discard it and
patronize F. B. Bye and bye Bolingbroke, who had a secret
partiality for the Jacobites, and mistrusted the Prince’s mission,
arrived, and affected such admiration for the periwig
that the Prince actually did wear it the next day in the throne-room,
to the horror of the Lord Chamberlain and Gentlemen
Ushers, while the crafty Bolingbroke took care himself to
appear in one of <span class="sc">Browne’s</span> most artistic and luxuriant head-coverings
that could possibly be procured; the result being
a perfect triumph for the Professor. The Queen expressed
high disapproval of the Prince’s Wig, whose mission thereby
failed, and once again the hopes of the Jacobites fluttered.
At length the wily Bolingbroke was dismissed from Office,
and Her Majesty, who had secured the succession to the
Crown of the son of her cousin Sophia, ordered that
Professor <span class="sc">Browne</span>, should henceforth be appointed Wig
Maker in ordinary to the British Public.</p>

<p>In the City the agitation was fearful. None could
doubt that the decisive crisis was approaching. It was
known, from the second edition of the <cite>Times</cite>, that the
joint Armada, carrying everything before it, was continuing
its victorious progress up the Channel. Plymouth
had fallen without firing a shot. Portsmouth had
speedily followed suit. The former had found itself, at
the eleventh hour, unprovided with a single gun. The
latter, at the crucial moment, discovered that it was
still waiting the arrival of its ammunition. When these
facts, mysteriously whispered at first with bated breath,
became, later in the day, authenticated by the
appearance of succeeding editions of the morning papers,
the public excitement knew no bounds. A hideous panic
seized the Stock Exchange. “Goschens” went down to
sixty at a single leap. Five well-known Stockbrokers
went off their heads, and were removed in cabs by the
police in violent hysterics. The Lord Mayor appeared
on the steps of the Mansion House, and endeavoured to
quell the riot. He was at once recognised by the mob,
and pelted with Pass-Books.</p>

<p>But things assumed a most threatening aspect at the
Admiralty. A vast multitude had assembled at Whitehall,
and rendered Parliament Street impassable. There
was an angry howl at the “Board.” The Police took
the precautionary measure of closing the gates. The
First Lord appeared inside the enclosure, and his
presence was the signal for an ominous roar. He was
deathly pale and trembling, but he managed to scramble
up the balustrade, and gazed feebly down on the raving
thousands below. He was understood to say that when
next Parliament met it would be asked to appoint
another Committee to inquire into the naval administration
of the country. His speech was cut short by
execrations, and he hastily withdrew. Ten minutes
later it was understood that he had escaped by the back
way over the palings into the Park, and was hiding
himself from the fury of the mob in an unfrequented
slum in Pimlico.</p>

<p>But while these events were transpiring in the
Metropolis of the Empire, still graver issues were being
arrived at on that “silver streak,” which, up to now, had
popularly, but erroneously, been regarded as its sure
defence. What had been left of the British Channel
Fleet after its first disastrous encounter with the joint
Armada off the Lizard had rallied, and was now awaiting
the attack of the again on-pressing and advancing enemy,
in what promised to be a decisive encounter for the
possession of the Mouth of the Thames, in the immediate
neighbourhood of Herne Bay. The Admiral, in his hasty
retreat, had collected about the shattered remnant of his
forces some auxiliary adjuncts. He had been joined by
Her Majesty’s ironclads, <i>Styx</i> and <i>Megatherium</i>, and by
the belted cruiser, <i>Daffodil</i>; but owing to the fact that
these vessels, not possessing any guns, had had to put to
sea without their armaments, the recent arrivals could
scarcely be counted on by him as an addition to his
fighting power in any pending action. Nor was he sure
of his own ship. Her Majesty’s ironclad <i>Blunderer</i>,
which carried his flag, was armed with four of the famous
43-ton Collingwood exploding guns, and though hard
pressed in the recent engagement, he had not thought it
wise to give the order to “fire.”</p>

<p>Such was the position of the British Admiral at the
commencement of that fatal afternoon which saw the
last blow struck for the preservation of the Empire. The
fight commenced by a general attack of the enemy. But
it did not last long. In a very few minutes seven of the
British ironclads, including that of the Admiral, were
blown up by the explosion of their own guns. The rest
found that they were supplied with the wrong-sized
ammunition, and were rapidly put <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. Within
a quarter of an hour of the firing of the first shot the
action was over, and the last remnant of the British
Fleet had practically disappeared. That evening the
advance despatch boats of the joint Armada anchored
off Gravesend, and 120,000 men were landed on the
Kentish coast between Margate and Whitstable.</p>

<p><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
When the news of the disaster appeared in the evening
papers, the panic, which had been gathering strength as the
day progressed, culminated in fever-heat. Everybody was
in the streets asking, with staring eyeballs, for the latest
news.</p>

<p>Gradually it became known that 75,000 of the enemy
were advancing on the capital by way of Aldershot, and
that the General in command at the camp, who had 1,371
men of all arms under him, all told, had received orders to
oppose them, and this announcement seemed to restore in
some measure the public confidence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a quite phenomenal activity prevailed at the
War Office, and the horses of the General Omnibus
Company were at once requisitioned for the service of the
Royal Artillery. The Duke of Cambridge, on hearing of
the catastrophe, had applied to the Authorities instantly for
the 11,000 men he had recently insisted on. With that force,
he said, even at the eleventh hour, he would guarantee the
safety of the country. Mr. Whitely forthwith undertook to
furnish them within twenty-four hours. His offer was
accepted with enthusiasm. It was known too that Lord
Wolseley had already started with a miscellaneous force of
Volunteers, Guards, and Policemen, hurriedly collected, for
Sydenham, with the intention of taking up a defensive
position among the antideluvian animals, and there waiting
the course of events.</p>

<p>The Authorities were fairly on their mettle. They
instantly supplied three Volunteer regiments with rifles of
an obsolete and antiquated pattern. Nor was this all.
They telegraphed to Woolwich to expedite the selection of
a model for the new magazine rifle, and marked their communication
“urgent.” Matters, meanwhile, at headquarters
were not less vigorously pushed forward. Inquiries
were made for Mr. Stanhope’s plan of “defending the
Thames.” Every pigeon-hole was examined, but it could
not be found. Still, the Department did not despair.
They despatched a third-class War Office clerk to Greenwich
to report on the situation and say what he thought
of it.</p>

<p>When, however, it transpired the next morning that, spite
all the efforts to stay their advance, 50,000 of the enemy
had taken possession of the Bank of England, seized the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen as hostages, and were prepared
to treat with the Government, with a view to evacuation, on
the cession of Margate, Canada, India, Gibraltar, Malta,
Australia, and Madame Tussaud’s Wax-work Collection,
together with a preliminary payment of fifteen milliards.
Englishmen began soberly to recognise that what they had
so long regarded as an impossible vision had really come
about, and that the “Next Armada” was an unhappily
accomplished fact.</p>

<p>“But while these stirring events were passing in the East,
the mind of England was turned into a very different channel.
No faithful historian could pass over this period
without touching upon a pastime which was now taking a
remarkable hold upon the nation, and pervading with its
influence the upper and middle classes of British society.</p>

<p>“Rackets, and the old French game of Tennis, had long
been popular with the English youth; but by those who had
left the public schools and universities they were generally
unattainable. It was left for Major Wingfield, the scion of
a Shropshire family, to bring home, I may almost say to
every door, a game which, little inferior to the classic
games which I have just mentioned, was open, without the
paraphernalia of a costly court, to every one at least who
possessed a moderate-sized and level lawn. Lawn-Tennis
was now rapidly elbowing out Archery, a thoroughly
English and deep-rooted institution, and Croquet, its
younger sister. Cricket was losing many of its most
earnest devotees. In some parts of England there was an
almost daily <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendezvous</i> at one or other of the great houses
of the neighbourhood for the new and popular pastime. In
country circles, tournaments were rousing the keenest
excitement. Society was being differentiated into the good
players and the bad. Crowds flocked annually to Wimbledon
to watch the great match for the Championship of
the world, to which a silver goblet had been added by <cite>The
Country Gentleman’s Newspaper</cite>. Masters of hounds
deferred cub-hunting that the Lawn Tennis season might
be still further prolonged. A game of Lawn-Tennis was
not unfrequently the innocent finish of the Ruridecanal
meetings of the clergy. “Will he make a fourth?” was
the first question to be asked about the new curate in many
a country parish. All-popular among the public schools
was Harrow-on-the-Hill, which had now furnished the
Lawn-Tennis Champion for four consecutive years. Politics
were laid aside in the public press while the rules of the
game were discussed. On one side were ranged the net-volleyers:
on the other those who thought that net-volleying
spoilt all the beauty and elegance of the game.
Never, by this latter party, since the time of Guy Fawkes,
had man been so intensely hated as he who, standing close
to the net with uplifted racket, stifled stroke after stroke as
they came to meet him. We shall not enter very fully into
the merits of this controversy; to do so would be dull, and
possibly, to future generations, unintelligible. It is
sufficient to say that while the skilled players defied “the
man at the net” to do his worst, another and a larger
party, looking, be it supposed, to the greatest happiness of
the greatest number, was clamouring for such Lawn-Tennis
legislation as would degrade the game to the capabilities of
mediocrity, and drive the odious net-player from the courts.
So numerous were the grades of dexterity that a leader in
the Tennis world, and an author of some repute, had
formulated a handicap table by which players of as many
degrees as the letters of the alphabet might be brought
together on even terms; while Henry Jones, the
“Cavendish” of the whist-table, and other mathematicians,
had worked out to several places of decimals the advantages
of service. * * * * Such was the state of things which
was distracting the mind of England while the fleets of
Europe patrolled the Mediterranean, and peace and war
were trembling in the balance.”</p>

<p class="p2">There are numerous other imitations of Lord Macaulay’s
prose writings. One, written by the late Dean Hook, is to

(<abbr title="volume two, page">vol ii., p.</abbr> 476), it relates only to ecclesiastical affairs.</p>

<p>Another, entitled <cite>The Story of Johnnie Armstrong</cite>, the
Scotch outlaw, appeared in the Newcastle Weekly Chronicle,
September 22, 1888. It was a prize composition of considerable
merit, written by Mr. J. T. Milne, but it is
unfortunately too long to be here inserted.</p>

<p>Of all the railroads as I ever came across that Great’rn is
out and out the worst, thro’ bein’ that tejus slow and the
carridges a mask of dirt as you might grow cabbidges on,
as the sayin’ is, and took all the freshness out of my light
blue pollynaise, as I’d thought the kerrect thing at Cambridge,
thro’ Mrs. Burgess a-wearin’ the same at the Boat-race,
and some young Cambridge gents a-sayin’ “Mum,
you’ve ’it the right colour this time and no mistake,” as
pleased ’er no end, tho’ all the time larfin’ at ’er, I’ve no
doubt, thro’ bein’ a orkard figger from a child and not one
to look well in a Joseph’s coat of many colours, as the sayin’
is.</p>

<p>’Ow ever I met Mrs. Vagg on that everlastin’ endless
platform I don’t know, but I says to ’er, “a pint of four ale
I must ’ave,” as I saw a refreshmint bar ’andy, but of all
the stuck-up trollopin’ things that barmaid was the most
orful, as ’ad dressed ’er ’air within a hinch of ’er life, as the
sayin’ is, in four false plaits, and three young men a-hoglin’
of ’er across the slab, as might ’ave known better, and took
cheek from that gal, as I’d ’ave paid ’er back, and let ’er
know ’er place.</p>

<p>I never wish to swaller a better cup of tea than Mrs. Vagg
gave me that evenin’ thro’ ’er bein’ a Bed-maker and in
course tea a perkisite, and is only fair with ’er maid-of-all-work
to seven gentlemen and board and lodge ’erself, not
but what ’er house wasn’t very nice, as bein’ in Regint
Street with Wictor Emmanivel’s Collidge opposight, for all
the world like Clerkenwell jail, with bars to the winders and
all, mayhap thro’ fear of burglars a-breakin’ in, and a-carryin’
off the Uniwersity chest, as I’m told would only be
poor pickins, and not worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Whether it was that cup of tea, or whether it was talkin’
over old times with Mrs. Vagg, as ’ad been in service with
me as a gal, but nine o’clock struck and took me all of a
’eap, thro’ ’avin’ promised Brown as I’d send ’im a ’a-penny
card just to say I was all right. So I says “What time do
the Post go out?”</p>

<p>“Ten o’clock,” says she, “but you’re never goin’ out
there to-night, and a Town and Gown row on too, as is what
no decent woman would face.”</p>

<p>“Beggin’ your parding, mum,” says I, “their aint no
Town nor Gown neither as shall stand in the way of my duty
to my lawful ’usband.”</p>

<p>So seen’ I was in earnest, she ’eld ’er tongue, and ’elped
me on with my shawl, and says “Turn to the left and foller
your nose, and that’ll bring you straight to the Post Office.”</p>

<p>Well up the hairy steps I went, thro’ ’er a-occypying the
ground floor, and a-lettin’ the first, and the very first thing
as I sees were a roamin’ candle goin’ off on Parky Peace as
they call it, tho’ a poorish Park to me as knows Grinnidge,
and as for Peace, it’s a-callin’ peace where there’s no peace,
thro’ bein’ a mask of folk all a-’ustling and a-jeerin’, and a-lettin’
off fireworks, as is things I don’t ’old with, thro’ John
Biggen as was my first cousin on the mother’s side bein’
blinded with a rocket at Vaux ’all, as were a piece of luck
for Mrs. Biggin, as no one would ’ave married with ’is eyes
open thro’ ’er face bein’ a puffect cullender from the smallpox.</p>

<p>What the rumpus was all about I don’t know, but the
streets was full of young men as would ’ave been better in
their beds, some on ’em a-walkin’ two and two and a-smokin’
pipes, and some jinin’ arms, and marchin’ up the streets
singin’ for all the world like as if they was tipsy, and the
pavemint that narrer as I was shoved off the kerb, and into
a gutter, as was a foot deep and wetted me up to my knees,
and clean spilte a new petticut, as such things should’nt be
allowed in the public streets,&mdash;and where’s their Board of
’Ealth?</p>

<p>There was two young fellers a-walkin’ be’ind me, and says
one, a-larfin’, and a-pintin’, “That’s a good make up,”
meanin’ me, as turned round sharp on ’im, and told ’im to
mind ’is own business and not talk about makin’ up to me as
were old enough to be ’is mother, let alone ’avin’ twice ’is
wits, as were not much better than a fool, and looked only
three days in the week, as the sayin’ is. But law bless you,
my lord only larfed, and just then I saw a great rampagious
mob a-tearin’ up the street as looked the scum of the earth,
and gave me that turn as I thought swound away I must, and
ketched ’old of ’is arm, and says, “’Elp a lady in distress,
and conduc me past them willains.”</p>

<p>Says he, a-takin’ off ’is ’at quite perlite, “With pleasure,
mum,” and off he walked with me a-’angin’ on to ’is arm,
and my ’eart a-thumpin’ with pannikin’ fear as might ’ave
been ’eard ’arf a mile away.</p>

<p>Well I was just a-slippin’ my ’a-penny card into the Post,
when up comes an elderly gent a-stridin’ along and a-lookin’
very big, with a gownd a-trailin’ in the mud, and the banns
of marridge round ’is neck for all the world like a parson, as
no doubt was, and says to the young gent, “Which I must
trouble you for six and eightpence for not a-wearin’ of your
hacademic dress,” and pulls out a sort of bettin’-book for to
enter ’is name and Collidge.</p>

<p>Says the young gent, quite cool and brazen-like, “Excuse
me, sir, but I was a-escortin’ of my mother ’ome, and didn’t
put on my gownd for fear of the cads.”</p>

<p>This put my blood up, as never could abear anything deceitful
or under’and, and I lets go of ’im, and says, “You
hartful young ’ypocrate, and me never ’avin’ set my eyes on
you before this evenin’, as must ’ave took ’im aback like and
serve ’im right, but he didn’t wait for no more, but ran off
like a harrer from a bow, as the sayin’ is, and the old chap
sets a long legged feller to run after ’im, as I ’ope didn’t
ketch ’im, thro’ bein’ a kind-’earted young man spite of ’is
owdacious fibbin’.”</p>

<p>By this time there was a reglar Punch and Judy crowd
round us, but I grabbed tight on to my umbreller, and thinks
I “’it me any of you who dare,” when the elderly gent says,
“If so be as you’re a decent woman, you’ll go ’ome.”</p>

<p>Says I, “who says as Martha Brown aint a decent woman,
you old waggerbone! I aint a goin’ to stand ’ere to be
hinsulted,” and was bouncin’ off feelin’ quite ’urt like, and
the crowd a cheerin’ and a sayin’, “Go it, old Fatchops,”
when if that old fool didn’t take and say as it were ’is duty
to see me ’ome.</p>

<p>Says I, “Thank you for nothin’, as would prefer you
did no such thing, thro’ me not bein known ’ere and people
might make remarks,” but, law bless you, words wasn’t no
good with ’im, as walked along side of me all the way with
the crowd a-follerin’ and a-hollerin’ and a-pokin’ their fun
at ’im and me.</p>

<p>Right glad I was to stand on Mrs. Vagg’s door-step, and
fainted clean away as soon as hever I got down to the
kitchen, and you don’t ketch me a-goin’ down that street
after dark again, and, tho’ boys will be boys, yet I don’t
’old with all their squibbin’ and fibbin’, nor yet with helderly
gents as is paid to hinsult respectable fieldmales, as I wish
my ’usband ’ad been there, as would ’ave broke hevery bone
in ’is skin and serve ’im right.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">BENJAMIN DISRAELI,</h3>

<p class="center larger">Lord Beaconsfield.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the burlesques of
the novels of Disraeli are not, as a rule, very
amusing, but there is one brilliant exception,
namely, that written by Bret Harte.</p>

<p>It is entitled “<cite>Lothaw</cite>, or the Adventures of a Young
Gentleman in Search of a Religion,” by Mr. Benjamins.
This was first printed in England by the late Mr. J. C.
Hotten in 1871. It consists of nine short chapters.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Lothaw.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Chapter</i> <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>“I remember him a little boy,” said the Duchess.
“His mother was a dear friend of mine: you know, she
was one of my bridesmaids.”</p>

<p>“And you have never seen him since, mamma?” asked
the oldest married daughter, who did not look a
day older than her mother.</p>

<p>“Never; he was an orphan shortly after. I have often
reproached myself, but it is so difficult to see boys.”</p>

<p>This simple yet first-class conversation existed in the
morning-room of Plusham, where the mistress of the
palatial mansion sat involved in the sacred privacy of a
circle of her married daughters.</p>

<p>One dexterously applied golden knitting-needles to the
fabrication of a purse of floss silk of the rarest texture,
which none who knew the almost fabulous wealth of the
Duke would believe was ever destined to hold in its silken
meshes a less sum than £1,000,000 sterling; another
adorned a slipper exclusively with seed pearls; a third
emblazoned a page with rare pigments and the finest
quality of gold-leaf.</p>

<p>Beautiful forms leaned over frames glowing with embroidery,
and beautiful frames leaned over forms inlaid
with mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>Others, more remote, occasionally burst into melody as
they tried the passages of a new and exclusive air given to
them in MS. by some titled and devoted friend, for the
private use of the aristocracy alone, and absolutely prohibited
for publication.</p>

<p>The Duchess, herself the superlative of beauty, wealth,
and position, was married to the highest noble in the
Three Kingdoms.</p>

<p>Those who talked about such matters said that their
progeny were exactly like their parents&mdash;a peculiarity of
the aristocratic and wealthy.</p>

<p>They all looked like brothers and sisters, except their
parents, who, such was their purity of blood, the perfection
of their manners, and the opulence of their condition,
might have been taken for their own children’s elder son
and daughter.</p>

<p>The daughters, with one exception, were all married to
the highest nobles in the land.</p>

<p>That exception was the Lady Coriander, who&mdash;there
being no vacancy above a marquis and a rental of
£1,000,000&mdash;waited.</p>

<p>Gathered around the refined and sacred circle of their
breakfast-table, with their glittering coronets, which, in
filial respect to their father’s Tory instinct and their
mother’s Ritualistic tastes, they always wore on their
regal brows, the effect was dazzling as it was refined.</p>

<p>It was this peculiarity and their strong family resemblance
which led their brother-in-law, the good-humoured
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Addlegourd, to say that, “’Pon my soul, you know,
the whole precious mob looked like a ghastly pack of
court cards&mdash;don’t you know?”</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Addlegourd was a radical.</p>

<p>Having a rent-roll of £15,000,000, and belonging to one
of the oldest families in Britain, he could afford to be.</p>

<p>“Mamma, I’ve just dropped a pearl,” said the Lady
Coriander, bending over the Persian hearth-rug.</p>

<p>“From your lips, sweet friend,” said Lothaw, who
came of age and entered the room at the same moment.</p>

<p>“No, from my work. It was a very valuable pearl,
mamma; papa gave Isaacs and Sons £50,000 for the
two.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed,” said the Duchess, languidly rising;
“let us go to luncheon.”</p>

<p>“But your Grace,” interposed Lothaw, who was still
quite young, and had dropped on all-fours on the carpet
in search of the missing gem, “consider the value&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dear friend,” interposed the Duchess, with infinite
tact, gently lifting him by the tails of his dress-coat, “I
am waiting for your arm.”</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>Chapter</i> <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p>Lothaw was immensely rich.</p>

<p>The possessor of seventeen castles, fifteen villas, nine
shooting-boxes, and seven town houses, he had other estates
of which he had not even heard.</p>

<p>Everybody at Plusham played croquet, and none badly.</p>

<p>Next to their purity of blood and great wealth, the
family were famous for this accomplishment.</p>

<p>Yet Lothaw soon tired of the game, and after seriously
damaging his aristocratically large foot in an attempt to
“tight croquet” the Lady Aniseed’s ball, he limped away
to join the Duchess.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the hennery,” she said.</p>

<p>“Let me go with you. I dearly love fowls&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p class="unindent">broiled,” he added, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“The Duke gave Lady Montairy some large Cochins the
other day,” continued the Duchess, changing the subject
with delicate tact.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i3">“Lady Montairy,</div>
<div class="i3">Quite contrairy,</div>
<div class="i1">How do your cochins grow?”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">sang Lothaw gaily.</p>

<p>The Duchess looked shocked. After a prolonged silence,
Lothaw abruptly and gravely <span class="lock">said&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“If you please, ma’am, when I come into my property I
should like to build some improved dwellings for the poor,
and marry Lady Coriander.”</p>

<p>“You amaze me, dear friend, and yet both your aspirations
are noble and eminently proper,” said the Duchess;
“Coriander is but a child&mdash;and yet,” she added, looking
graciously upon her companion, “for the matter of that, so
are you.”</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>Chapter</i> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<p>Mr. Putney Padwick’s was Lothaw’s first grand dinner-party.</p>

<p>Yet, by carefully watching the others, he managed to
acquit himself creditably, and avoided drinking out of the
finger-bowl by first secretly testing its contents with a
spoon.</p>

<p>The conversation was peculiar, and singularly interesting.</p>

<p>“Then you think that monogamy is simply a question
of the thermometer?” said Mrs. Putney Padwick to her
companion.</p>

<p>“I certainly think that polygamy should be limited by
isothermal lines,” replied Lothaw.</p>

<p><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
“I should say it was a matter of latitude,” observed a
loud, talkative man opposite.</p>

<p>He was an Oxford Professor, with a taste for satire,
and had made himself very obnoxious to the company,
during dinner, by speaking disparagingly of a former
well-known Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;a great statesman,
and brilliant novelist,&mdash;whom he feared and hated.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sensation in the room; among the
females it absolutely amounted to a nervous thrill.</p>

<p>His Eminence, the Cardinal, was announced.</p>

<p>He entered with great suavity of manner, and after
shaking hands with everybody, asking after their relatives,
and chucking the more delicate females under the chin with
a high-bred grace peculiar to his profession, he sat down,
<span class="lock">saying&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“And how do we all find ourselves this evening, my
dears?” in several different languages, which he spoke
fluently.</p>

<p>Lothaw’s heart was touched.</p>

<p>His deeply religious convictions were impressed.</p>

<p>He instantly went up to this gifted being, confessed, and
received absolution.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” he said to himself, “I will partake of
the Communion, and endow the Church with my vast
estates. For the present I’ll let the improved cottages go.”</p>

chimed furiously; howls, curses, flights of brickbats,
stones shivering windows, groans of wounded men, cries
of frightened females, cheers of either contending party as
it charged the enemy from Carfax to Trumpington Street,
proclaimed that the battle was at its height.</p>

<p>In Berlin they would have said it was a revolution, and
the cuirassiers would have been charging, sabre in hand,
amidst that infuriate mob. In France they would have
brought down artillery, and played on it with twenty-four-pounders.
In Cambridge nobody heeded the disturbance&mdash;it
was a Town and Gown row.</p>

<p>The row arose at a boat-race. The Town boat
(manned by eight stout bargees, with the redoubted
Rullock for stroke) had bumped the Brazennose light
oar, usually at the head of the river. High words arose
regarding the dispute. After returning from Granchester,
when the boats pulled back to Christchurch meadows,
the disturbance between the Townsmen and the
University youths&mdash;their invariable opponents&mdash;grew
louder and more violent, until it broke out in open
battle. Sparring and skirmishing took place along the
pleasant fields that lead from the University gate down
to the broad and shining waters of the Cam, and under
the walls of Baliol and Sidney Sussex. The Duke of
Bellamont (then a dashing young sizar at Exeter) had
a couple of rounds with Billy Butt, the bow oar of the
Bargee boat. Vavasour of Brazennose was engaged with
a powerful butcher, a well-known champion of the Town
party, when, the great University bells ringing to dinner,
truce was called between the combatants, and they
retired to their several colleges for refection.</p>

<p>During the boat-race, a gentleman pulling in a canoe,
and smoking a Nargilly, had attracted no ordinary attention.
He rowed about a hundred yards ahead of the boats
in the race, so that he could have a good view of that
curious pastime. If the eight-oars neared him, with a few
rapid strokes of his flashing paddles his boat shot a
furlong ahead; then he would wait, surveying the race,
and sending up volumes of odour from his cool Nargilly.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked the crowds who panted along the
shore, encouraging, according to Cambridge wont, the
efforts of the oarsmen in the race. Town and Gown,
alike asked who it was, who, with an ease so provoking,
in a barque so singular, with a form seemingly so slight,
but a skill so prodigious, beat their best men. No
answer could be given to the query, save that a
gentleman in a dark travelling-chariot, preceded by six
fourgons and a courier, had arrived the day before at the
Hoop Inn, opposite Brazennose, and that the stranger of
the canoe seemed to be the individual in question.</p>

<p>No wonder the boat, that all admired so, could compete
with any that ever was wrought by Cambridge
artificer or Putney workmen. That boat&mdash;slim, shining,
and shooting through the water like a pike after a small
fish&mdash;was a caique from Tophana; it had distanced the
Sultan’s oarsmen, and the best crews of the Capitan
Pasha in the Bosphorus; it was the workmanship of
Togrul-Beg, Caikjee Bashee of his Highness. The
Bashee had refused fifty thousand tomauns from Count
Boutenieff, the Russian Ambassador, for that little
marvel. When his head was taken off, the Father of
Believers presented the boat to Rafael Mendoza.</p>

<p class="center">(In imitation of Disraeli’s <cite>Sybil</cite>.)</p>

<p>For there opposed each other but two elements in this
society at once strange and simple. Around the throne
of the Great Peter, and in the marble city which is his
monument, the gay circles of the Aristocracy frittered
away a frivolous existence amid the blaze of diamonds,
the strains of music, and all those Circean enchantments
that dull the energy and bid care repose. Here was
wealth to make life easy, and here luxury to give it
splendour; here was beauty to stir the pulse of youth,
and here wit to waken even the most thoughtless to a
sense that for them too there were pleasures of the
intellect. So lived the lords of those vast plains, whose
immensity made aptly significant the proud title of “All
the Russias.” And the tiller of those plains, what of
him? Surrounded by the sad and sombre Steppe, that
breathed its melancholy over him from the cradle,
broken by toil and of untutored mind, his life was
suffering without interval of enjoyment, degradation
without hope of change. Too brutish for the aspirations
of Religion, he was well-nigh bereft of that supreme
solace wherewith the ingenuity of the sophistical
rhetorician may seek to sooth even the aged pauper of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Pancras. And yet Revolution was as impossible for him
as content. For Revolution is the explosion of an Idea,
that overturns Society in its struggle to the light. To
the Scythian serf was altogether wanting the initial force
of the fulminating Idea. Steeped in ignorance, he was
also isolated. Through his dreary continent had never
permeated the Secret Societies of other lands, and for
him there was no magic potency in the mysterious name
of “Mary-Anne.” So he thought not of overturning
Society, but of effacing it. For the first time in man’s
history was seen that portentous birth, an Apostle of
Nothing. In a word, he was a Nihilist!</p>

<p><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
Vainly was it attempted to divert his purposes by the
lure of foreign conquest and a fresh Crusade; in vain was
dangled before him by the astute Ministers of Muscovy
the long-sought guerdon of his efforts&mdash;the sacred city of
the Sultans. One was on the watch who came of a race
not lightly to be beguiled, a race that was ancient thirty
centuries before these Scythian hordes had claimed to be
a nation. The Great Minister of the West, strong with
the might and majesty of England, saw that it was
reserved for him to crown that Royal Mistress, on whose
brow he had recently set a new and Imperial coronet,
with the fresh garland of a bloodless triumph. In the
lofty language of the sacred records of his people, ‘Let
there be Peace!’ he said; and that which he achieved
became known to the world in his own historic phrase of
“Peace with Honour!”</p>

<p>“What majority had they last night, my lord?” asked a
fair young man in the Carlton, from a stately personage
who was sitting at a table near him, occupied with a
bottle of Lafitte.</p>

<p>“Fifty-two,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“How did Peel look when he heard it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he smiled in his usual quiet triumphant way,”
said Lord Mannerley.</p>

<p>“Ah! while Peel is sultan there will be no want of
ruined villages for our political owls to make their nests
in,” remarked the youth.</p>

<p>“Yes, these cursed free-traders flourish on the ruins of
the agriculturalists,” said Lord Mannerly savagely.</p>

<p>“And they will be soon howling like jackals in the
ruins of the constitution,” added his young companion,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“This Lafitte is capital,” said the ruined landowner.</p>

<p>At this moment a young man approached the table.
His bearing was proud, his eyes dark and luminous, his
figure stately as a palm-tree. His aquiline nose betrayed
his superb organisation. You saw at once that he was of
the purest Caucasian race. Yes! his lineage sprung from
the families who peopled the noble mountain which
received the Divine Ark, and cherished the snowy dove
that spread its white wings over the waters, that had
swallowed up the inhabitants of a world! As he passed
up the noble room, how insignificant in <em>his</em> presence
appeared the children of the semi-civilized barbarians,
spawned in a northern swamp!</p>

<p>“May I offer you a glass of claret, De Tankard?” asked
Lord Mannerley.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I only drink sherbet, just now,” replied
the youth.</p>

<p>“You can get some Persian sherbet at a penny a
glass,” said a witty Milesian lord.</p>

<p>De Tankard smiled compassionately on the aristocratic
buffoon. “’Tis doubtless worthy of your English civilization,”
was his calm scornful reply.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p class="center">Chapter <abbr title="Forty-four"><span class="sc lowercase">XLIV</span>.</abbr></p>

<p>De Tankard stood at the window of a small country inn,
and watched the storm raging in the forest. Lithely
bent the straight poplar with a low wail beneath the
breath of the north wind. The oak roared, the beech
howled, and the wild leaves, caught in the eddies of the
winds, were wreathed by them into chaplets, as though
the Spirit of the Storm wished to crown with them the
noble gazer on his work.</p>

<p>“’Tis a great spectacle,” remarked De Tankard, to a
man who stood beside him, of an air&mdash;oh, how grand!</p>

<p>Benonia (for it was indeed he!) sneered. “Have you
ever seen a Mediterranean white squall, or a whirlwind in
the Desert?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Alas, no!” was the reply. “I must soon visit the
glorious East, the parent of religion, civilization,
science, and art,” and the dark eyes of De Tankard glowed
with Eastern fire.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are young,” exclaimed Benonia, with
enthusiasm. “Glorious youth! By youth have all
great deeds been accomplished. Ransack the history of
ages. The fact is stamped on every line. The Trojan,
Paris, was but a youth when he ran away with the fair
Grecian, and got his native town destroyed for it ten years
after! Cæsar was in the freshness of life when he
destroyed the Republic and founded a despotism. Nero
developed his villany early, and Heliogabalus was a
confirmed glutton before his minority was over! Nay, to
come to our own country, what was the age of the Boy
Jones when he passed the sacred precincts of a Royal
palace, and stood where none but Royal feet had ever
trod before?&mdash;Barely sixteen! Look at Lord William
Lennox&mdash;how young he was when he wrote his great
works!”</p>

<p>Benonia paused. De Tankard dropped a warm and
sparkling tear. “I will start to the East to-morrow!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You had better have a couple of millions,” said
Benonia. “I have got about half-a-dozen in my pocket
to carry me over the night.”</p>

<p>Silence reigns beneath the brilliant azure of an Oriental
sky;&mdash;silence, broken only by the silver tinkling of the
camel’s bell. A noble creature is the camel. Compared
with that Caucasian of beasts, the shapeless quadruped of
the Northern, is but an ass!</p>

<p>Ever and anon, through the moist perfumed twilight,
steals a delicious breeze. Delicious, but melancholy.
For in that breeze floats a prophet’s sigh. The cypress
moans as it passes; and the palm-tree bows its proud
head in honour to it, as it flies along! On the holy
barrenness of the saintly brow of Lebanon, the moon’s
rays fall reverently, and Lebanon looks holier under their
light.</p>

<p>In the court in front of the counting-house of an Emir,
sits De Tankard. From among the round pebbles of the
pavement, springs a fresh fountain. On the branches of
the trees gleam ripe oranges.</p>

<p>The young man looked sad and solemn. He had that
morning seen an angel, as usual! By his side was a
lovely female, and near him the lively young Emir
Baboo smoked his nargilly.</p>

<p>“Do you often see angels, De Tankard?” he asked,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Peace!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I have a combination!” cried out the Emir, jumping
up with a violence which smashed the nargilly. “Let us
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
get the Druses and Maronites to unite, and we’ll go down
to Djouni, and seize the English frigate there! What
would Palmerston say to that?”</p>

<p>De Tankard laughed. “The East is the cradle of
glory,” said he after a pause, with an enthusiastic look.</p>

<p>The Emir stared.</p>

<p>“Ah”! said he, “I had a brave chase yesterday, and
ran off with the baggage of a caravan.”</p>

<p>The lady frowned. The Emir fell at her feet, and
began to cry.</p>

<p>Next day, De Tankard started off with him on an
excursion.</p>

<p>When employed in these ennobling diversions, he
learned that his rich maiden aunt had arrived at
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“Advantage, we win,” shouted Sphairistikos.</p>

<p>“Never,” replied Retiarius, as he made his favourite
stroke, which came speeding, whirling, hissing, the one-thousandth
part of an inch over the top of the net, and
fell twisting, twirling, shooting, in the extreme left-hand
corner of the great twelve-yard court, only to be returned,
however, by the flexibility of a wrist which had been
famous in Harrow’s playing-fields in days of yore.</p>

<p>“Forty-thirty.”</p>

<p>“Deuce.”</p>

<p>“’Vantage against you!” “Game and set!” Such
were the Babel-like cries which greeted our ears, as we
approached Tong Castle’s level lawn, one fine autumnal
afternoon.</p>

<p>And what was the scene that confronted us?</p>

<p>Ambitious adversaries, on all sides, were hitting to and
fro, in alternated strokes, a gyratory ball, and loudly
vociferating amœbean numerals as either side became
involved in some reticular difficulty.</p>

<p>Here was to be seen, in variegated garb, such a galaxy
of beauty as Shropshire seldom sees, assembled to render
homage to the great Lawn-Tennis Champion, and to
witness the feats of some of England’s doughtiest
players.</p>

<p>Here were to be seen the eagle-eyed volleyer, the deft
half-volleyer, the swift server, and the nimble net-player;
while here, too, the quick cut, the treacherous twister,
and the brilliant back-hander were exhibited on all sides
in their purest perfection.</p>

<p>“Advantage, we win,” repeated Sphairistikos.</p>

<p>“Deuce,” said Retiarius, as his great stroke passed and
shot lightning-like past his adversary’s racket.</p>

<p>And so they played and played on, till the balls began
to glance in the golden light of a glorious sunset, and
then to grow dimmer and dimmer in the deepening
shadows of a rich twilight.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Chapter</span> <abbr title="Two"><span class="sc lowercase">II.</span></abbr></p>

<p>But to what was all this tending, and to what condition
had the Lawn-Tennis players brought the Great Western
State which they inhabited?</p>

<p>A monarch on the throne, whose age alone prevented
her from casting in her lot with an aristocracy of wealth
and learning, who had already commenced to narrow life
within the limits of the twelve-yard court!!</p>

<p>A gentler sex, forsaking the sacred duties of
domesticity that they might lend grace and elegance to
the all-prevailing pastime!!</p>

<p>A degraded peasantry, living but to delineate on level
lawns the bounds past which England’s greatest and
noblest born must not propel the gyrating sphere!!</p>

<p>A rustic generation, rising but to collect for their
oppressors the distant-driven ball, and developing into
manhood merely to tend and trim the smooth-shaven
Lawn-Tennis ground, which had now become a necessary
adjunct alike to glebe and manor!!</p>

<p>It was an age of Lawn-Tennis!!</p>

<p>“My prophetical instincts tell me,” said Retiarius, as
he and his friends were waiting for the nets to be
arranged,&mdash;“My prophetical instincts tell me that the
great coming stroke will be the volley.”</p>

<p>“Why, so?” said Sphairistikos.</p>

<p>“It is as yet,” replied he, “only half-developed. A
nation young in Lawn-Tennis has much to learn; much
to forget. My impression is that the volley, properly
understood, will convulse the future.”</p>

<p>“I believe in service for my part,” remarked
Sphairistikos,&mdash;“Secure your first stroke. Demoralize
first, win afterwards; I would borrow from the great
nation which gave us Tennis, and say, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Ce n’est que le
premier pas qui coûte.’</span>”</p>

<p>“But I am looking to a distant future,” continued
Retiarius. “We shall see great changes. There will be
hereditary volleyers. The theories of Darwin must
prevail. Volleyers will play with volleyers. The
pastimes of a country lead to its courtships. It has
always been so. A generation of volleyers will rise up
who will volley from the service-line as accurately as their
grandfathers have done from the nets.”</p>

<p>“What news from Afghanistan?” asked a fair player,
who was putting on her shoes.</p>

<p>“Fifteen, the Government loses,” replied a Tennis-steeped
youth; “they have served two faults,&mdash;one into
Afghanistan; one into Zululand.”</p>

<p>“Bother Afghanistan,” said another damsel in short
petticoats, “I want the scoring question settled.”</p>

<p>But the attendants now announced that the courts
were ready.</p>

<p>“Fifteen, I win.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen, all.”</p>

<p>And so on, and on, and on, the adversaries played,
with constantly-varying fortunes, till another day was
nearly done, and they were once more compelled to
surrender before the flickering blaze of a vanishing sun.</p>

It was known that Lord Beaconsfield had
drawn many of the characters in <cite>Endymion</cite>
from prominent members of society, and much
curiosity was felt as to the identification of
these individuals. <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> published

cautious not to paint his portraits too

<p>A curious story of a plagiarism is related of Disraeli in
the Life of Mr. Abraham Hayward, Q.C., who was
formerly on the staff of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>.</p>

<p>Early in the “fifties,” Mr. Disraeli made sundry depreciatory
remarks on the speeches of military members of
Parliament, classing them contemptuously as effusions of
“the military mind.” The men of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>
replied to Mr. Disraeli’s attack on the intellect of soldiers
by printing a translation of a magnificent eulogium on the
Maréchal de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cyr by M. Thiers, setting forth the
qualities necessary to a military commander. Mr. Disraeli
was evidently struck by the brilliancy of the counter hit,
for a few years later, when the Duke of Wellington died,
he interpolated the translation, <em>errors and all</em>, in the
oration which as leader of the House of Commons it was
his duty to deliver on the death of that great general.
The old writers of the <cite>Chronicle</cite> secured the insertion of
the speech and the translated passage in the <cite>Globe</cite>.
Mr. Disraeli’s friends made every attempt to explain away
the plagiarism till an article in <cite>Fraser’s Magazine</cite>, written
by Mr. Hayward, showed clearly that the passage was not
even taken from the French original, but directly from the
translation which appeared in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>.
Mr. Hayward was very proud of this article of his, in
which he also handled Mr. Disraeli’s “Revolutionary
Epick” very roughly.</p>

teacher of jig-dancing, of Fulwood’s-rents, Holborn.
This is a story of what a woman’s impatience can procure,
and what a man’s irresolution can achieve. If the law
were not such a blundering battering-ram the events
which fill these pages might have merited its attention.
I live with my mother, who keeps a general shop. Events

Why? I know not. Perhaps Laura knows, or Sir
Pursefull. I am asked to make a statement. Aided by a

shouting “There they go, millions of ’em.” When the
doctor saw her he winked at the count and whispered,
“Delicious trimmings,” but the poor thing was plainly
dressed. That’s all I know. Heartbright finishes the
story: We are to be married in a week’s time. Laura’s
faculties have returned. Mr. Bearly and his nerves have
found Nirvana. Sir Pursefull was drowned while showing
off a lifebelt of his own invention. Bosco is in an asylum.
His time is occupied in plucking green mice from his
beard, and chirruping to pink canaries which he fancies
he sees on the wall. My mother, always of a retiring
disposition, has given up business. I am heir of Gummeridge
House. Thus it ends.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Luck of Tory Camp.</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>By Bread Tart.</cite></p>

<p>There was commotion in Tory Camp. Outside a rude
cabin waited an excited crowd, headed by Solly, a stalwart
digger, with a Raphael face and profusion of dark beard,
whose duel with Harden Bill, the Rad-Dog Woodcutter,
was still talked of with bated breath. The name of a
woman was on every lip, a name familiar in the camp&mdash;Poll
Icy. The less said of her the better; no better than
she should be perhaps; half foreign, half Ingin; but yet
the only woman in camp, and now in woman’s direst
extremity. Suddenly an excited Celestial joined the
group. “Lemme investigate, John,” said he; “me Pal-Mal,
me washee-washee dirty linen, me go see her.”
“Scoot, you dern skunk!” thundered Solly; “none but a
down-east johnny-cake ’ud trust you with any woman
nowadays.” At that moment a wail, feeble, yet sufficient
to quell the laughter that greeted Solly’s sally, announced
a birth in Tory Camp.… Little Randy, or the
Luck&mdash;for by these names the frolicsome miners had
christened the infant (in beer)&mdash;grew and throve, and soon
became a power in the camp. His childish jokes with
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
Sairey Gamp, his nurse, were the delight of the brawny
getters of gold from quartz (s), and even Solly smiled
when the Luck “tackled the old ’un,” which he did when
Harden Bill visited the camp now and then. “Rastled
with Bill’s little finger, the derned little cuss,” roared
Solly; “rastled with it, dern my skin.”</p>

<p>The winter of 1885 will long be remembered in California.
One night Tea-Pot Gulch and Rad-Dog Fork leaped suddenly
over their banks, and descended in ruin upon Tory
Camp. When morning dawned the Luck lay lifeless in
Solly’s arms, and Harden Bill smiled grimly as he watched
the strangely assorted pair floating quietly towards the
Sea of Oblivion.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Naval Officer.</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>By Captain Marryat, R.N.</cite></p>

<p>My father was a north-country surgeon. He had
retired, a widower from Her Majesty’s navy many years
before, and had a small practice in his native village.
When I was seven years old he employed me to carry
medicines to his patients. Being of a lively disposition,
I sometimes amused myself, during my daily rounds, by
mixing the contents of the different phials. Although I
had no reason to doubt that the general result of this
practice was beneficial, yet, as the death of a consumptive
curate followed the addition of a strong mercurial lotion
to his expectorant, my father concluded to withdraw me
from the profession and send me to school.</p>

<p>Grubbins, the schoolmaster, was a tyrant, and it was
not long before my impetuous and self-willed nature
rebelled against his authority. I soon began to form
plans of revenge. In this I was assisted by Tom Snaffle&mdash;a
school-fellow. One day Tom suggested:</p>

<p>“Suppose we blow him up. I’ve got two pounds of
gun-powder!”</p>

<p>“No, that’s too noisy,” I replied.</p>

<p>Tom was silent for a minute, and again spoke.</p>

<p>“You remember how you flattened out the curate,
Pills! Couldn’t you give Grubbins something&mdash;something
to make him leathery sick&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>A flash of inspiration crossed my mind. I went to the
shop of the village apothecary. He knew me; I had
often purchased vitriol, which I poured into Grubbins’s
inkstand to corrode his pens and burn up his coat-tail, on
which he was in the habit of wiping them. I boldly
asked for an ounce of chloroform. The young apothecary
winked and handed me the bottle.</p>

<p>It was Grubbins’s custom to throw his handkerchief
over his head, recline in his chair, and take a short nap
during recess. Watching my opportunity, as he dozed, I
managed to slip his handkerchief from his face and substitute
my own, moistened with chloroform. In a few
minutes he was insensible. Tom and I then quickly
shaved his head, beard, and eyebrows, blackened his face
with a mixture of vitriol and burnt cork, and fled. There
was a row and scandal the next day. My father always
excused me by asserting that Grubbins had got drunk&mdash;but
somehow found it convenient to procure me an
appointment in Her Majesty’s navy at an early day.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two"><span class="sc lowercase">II.</span></abbr></p>

<p>An official letter, with the Admiralty seal, informed me
that I was expected to join H.M. ship Belcher, Captain
Boltrope, at Portsmouth, without delay. In a few days
I presented myself to a tall, stern-visaged man, who was
slowly pacing the leeward side of the quarter-deck. As I
touched my hat he eyed me sternly:</p>

<p>“So ho! Another young suckling. The service is
going to the devil. Nothing but babes in the cockpit
and grannies in the board. Boatswain’s mate, pass the
word for Mr. Cheek!”</p>

<p>Mr. Cheek, the steward, appeared and touched his hat.</p>

<p>“Introduce Mr. Breezy to the young gentlemen. Stop!
Where’s Mr. Swizzle?”</p>

<p>“At the masthead, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Lankey?”</p>

<p>“At the masthead, sir.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Briggs?”</p>

<p>“Masthead, too, sir.”</p>

<p>“And the rest of the young gentlemen?” roared the
enraged officer.</p>

<p>“All masthead, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Captain Boltrope, as he smiled grimly,
“under the circumstances, Mr. Breezy, you had better go
to the masthead too.”</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CHAPTER <abbr title="Three"><span class="sc lowercase">III</span>.</abbr></p>

<p>At the masthead I made the acquaintance of two
youngsters of about my own age, one of whom informed
me that he had been there 332 days out of the year.</p>

<p>“In rough weather, when the old cock is out of sorts,
you know, we never come down,” added a young gentleman
of nine years, with a dirk nearly as long as himself,
who had been introduced to me as Mr. Briggs. “By the
way, Pills,” he continued, “how did you come to omit
giving the captain a naval salute!”</p>

<p>“Why, I touched my hat,” I said, innocently.</p>

<p>“Yes, but that isn’t enough, you know. That will do
very well at other times. He expects the naval salute
when you first come on board&mdash;greeny!”</p>

<p>I began to feel alarmed, and begged him to explain.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, after touching your hat, you should
have touched him lightly with your forefinger in his
waistcoat, so, and asked, ‘How’s his nibs?’&mdash;you see?”</p>

<p>“How’s his nibs?” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Exactly. He would have drawn back a little, and
then you should have repeated the salute, remarking
‘How’s his royal nibs?’ asking cautiously after his wife
and family, and requesting to be introduced to the
gunner’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“The gunner’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“The same; you know she takes care of us young
gentlemen; now don’t forget, Pillsy!”</p>

<p>When we were called down to the deck I thought it a
good chance to profit by this instruction. I approached
Captain Boltrope and repeated the salute without conscientiously
omitting a single detail. He remained for a
moment livid and speechless. At length he gasped out:</p>

<p>“Boatswain’s mate!”</p>

<p>“If you please, sir,” I asked, tremulously, “I should
like to be introduced to the gunner’s daughter!”</p>

<p>“O, very good, sir!” screamed Captain Boltrope,
rubbing his hands and absolutely capering about the
deck with rage. “O d&mdash;n you! Of course you shall!
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
O ho! the gunner’s daughter! O, h&mdash;ll! this is too
much! Boatswain’s mate!” Before I well knew where
I was, I was seized, borne to an eightpounder, tied upon it
and flogged!</p>

<p>“I feel kinder dull,” said Tiger Tom to me one day.
“Let us go and kill some ‘Injins.’” We soon reached
the forest, but not a Redskin was in sight. Tom examined
the trail closely, and with an old backwoodsman’s
unerring instinct declared we should see no “Injins”
that day. As I was complimenting him upon his
wonderful sagacity, we were suddenly surprised by a
band of the dreaded Chickatoos. With one thought for
those at home Tom took to his heels and vanished. The
savages bound me to a tree, and told me not to run away.
I promised not to.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two"><span class="sc lowercase">II.</span></abbr></p>

<p>An exciting discussion upon cookery, of which I was
the central object, followed. One advocated roasting,
another baking me! I did not favour either. Between
them I got into a stew. At night, whilst the rascals
slept, I perceived an Indian maiden by my side. She
unbound me, and gave me the full dress of a chief, and
some pigment to stain my skin with. To disguise myself
was the work of a minute and three-quarters, when the
savages awoke, and missing me, set up a terrific yell, and
started in pursuit. To avoid observation, I accompanied
them.</p>

<p class="center sc lowercase">CHAPTER <abbr title="Three"><span class="sc lowercase">III.</span></abbr></p>

<p>The chase was particularly close. I was anxiously
awaiting nightfall to escape them, when, horror! something
wet touched my cheek. It was raining. The rain
fell in torrents, and as it washed my colour off and I
gradually became white, the Chickatoos saw through my
disguise. Seizing his rifle, the chief told me to stand
apart. He fired, but missed me. I feigned to be hit, and
springing into the air, turned sixteen distinct somersaults.
Before they recovered from their surprise, I disappeared
in the forest.</p>

<p>In this competition, the compositions were limited to
300 words, which prevented the authors from giving more
than a very rough caricature of their originals. But in
1867, Mr. Walter Parke contributed a parody of Captain
Mayne Reid to <cite>Judy</cite> free from any such harrassing restriction,
and succeeded in producing a most blood-curdling
romance. It was entitled “<cite>The Skull Hunters</cite>: A Terrific
Tale of the Prairie!!” By Captain Rayne Meade;
and consisted of twenty-one chapters of thrilling adventures,
and daring exploits with illustrations to match.
This was published in book form in 1868, another and
revised edition was brought out in 1887, during the
excitement about Buffalo Bill’s Wild West. This had a
tremendous sale, it was called “<cite>sportmans</cite>; or,
The Warriors of the Wild West.” <cite>Judy</cite> Office, London.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">ANTICIPATIONS OF THE DERBY.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">By a French Visitor.</span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Homme qui Rit.</i></p>

<p>“In England, everything is great, even that which is
not good, even oligarchy itself!” Thought profound and
sublime of the Master; <a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>apothegm initiatory and bitter of
the Man who Laughs&mdash;who laughs, but who can also
bite.</p>

<p>For Genius, as for Ambition&mdash;for Prometheus who
thinks, as for Prometheus who wields the great battalions&mdash;seems
it not that there is reserved, by the derisive
irony of Fate, an expiatory rock, an island exile?</p>

<p>For Victor Hugo, this rock, expiatory but glorious,
calls itself Guernsey.</p>

<p>For Napoleon, it had two names; it was Elba, and it
was Ste. Hélène.</p>

<p>Patience, Master! Watching the brumous clouds,
tainted with Britannic fogs, that roll around the Islands
of the Sleeve in the crepusculary sadness of an English
spring&mdash;listening to the breeze, keen, acute, Arctic,
Polar, which groans, which growls, which howls, which
whistles menacing but impuissant, around the walls of
Hauteville House&mdash;remember thyself, Master, that
History, as for Ambition, so for Genius, repeats herself,
in moments, for the one of remorse, for the other of
caprice!</p>

<p>After Elba, the Hundred Days.</p>

<p>After Ste. Hélène, the voyage of the Belle-Poule.</p>

<p>“He laughs best who laughs last,” says the Proverb.</p>

<p>Proverbs are the wisdom of nations.</p>

<p>And thou, oh Master, oh author of the Man who
Laughs, thy laugh is as the laugh of Gwynplaine, sombre
but not cynical, permanent but full of pity, of compassion&mdash;a
laughter broken with tears&mdash;above all, a
laughter which endures!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <i>The Solidarity of the Sportmans.</i></p>

<p>Yes; in England, everything is great. Even in her
sports, she is the Titaness of the Ocean.</p>

<p>There is a solidarity of peoples; above all, there is a
solidarity amongst the votaries of Diana, huntress pale,
chaste, ferocious, formidable, but ravishing, but divine!</p>

<p>The <em>sportmans</em> of France, the <em>sportmans</em> of England,
they are as the brothers of Corsica. What says your
Williams? “As we were being washed by nurse, we got
completely mixed!”</p>

<p>Touching and tender fantasy of this grand old Swan of
Stratford-upon-Thames! Or, what say I&mdash;of Corsica?
Of Siam&mdash;melancholy but affecting type of the rudimentary
solidarity of the Orient!</p>

<p>I had long desired to watch you insularies in the sports
of the hippodrome, in which I am myself not without
skill; but the furious storms of the Sleeve twice detained
me at Calais, and once at Boulogne. I consoled myself
in the hope that everything comes to him who knows how
to wait.</p>

<p>I knew how to wait. I waited.</p>

<p>After Chantilly, Epsom’s courses!</p>

<p>The sea appeared calm; not a wrinkle in the folds of
the steel-blue Sleeve.</p>

<p>I embarked myself, with my luggage in my left hand
and my “Ruff’s Guide to the Turf” in my right.</p>

<p>I shall see them, then, at last&mdash;these courses, sacred in
the past by the memory of Eclipse and the Flying
Admiral Childers, dear to the patriotic heart of France in
the present days by the triumph of Gladiateur!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="pageno">245</span>
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <i>Ocean less Perfidious than the Aristocracy
of Albion.</i></p>

<p>The sun was shining. The Ocean stirred gently in
its sleep. Its ripples were as tender, as voluptuous,
as the sighs of pleasure which scarcely derange the
diaphanous scarf that lies upon the bosom of beauty.
Oh, Phœbus! Oh, Neptunus! Oh, Venus!</p>

<p>I told you the sun was shining. My heart also. That
I was gay! Gaiety premature, unreasonable, absurd!</p>

<p>As we cross Calais Bar the vessel rolls. I like it not.
Can she be strong enough for the traverse, often fearful
and stormy, to Douvres? I begin to marvel whether she
is made of iron, or only made of wood.</p>

<p>I address the question, politely, to a young English
<em>sportmans</em> by my side&mdash;“Pardon, Mister! but what is the
vessel made of?”</p>

<p>A spasm of uncertainty, if not of pain, passes across his
face as he points to an inscription inside the paddle-boxes.</p>

<p>One can only die one time; nevertheless, it is permitted
to exclaim against the perfidy of the Steam-Lords of the
Board of Commerce for London and Douvres. I read the
inscription. Hope abandons me. The vessel is <em>not</em> made
of iron!</p>

<p>She is not even made of wood!!</p>

<p>She is only “Maid of Kent!!!”</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> <i>Portentosum Mare.</i></p>

<p>An agitation which I have never felt before seems
to seize upon me.</p>

<p>The further we go, the more it increases.</p>

<p>The young English <em>sportmans</em>, with the cynical indifference
of the patrician, contemplates my sufferings, and
lights his cigar. Is it that he calls <em>that</em> “solidarity”?</p>

<p>Two blonde misses with their papa&mdash;oligarch, fat, and
without sympathy&mdash;sit near me. They talk to each other
freely. At times they laugh. I laugh not, I!</p>

<p>Nor would <em>they</em> laugh, spoilt infants of Fashion, if I
were to express the ideas that are struggling in my bosom&mdash;if
I were to show them all that is within me!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> <i>After Convulsion, Despair.</i></p>

<p>I have shown them all that was within me.</p>

<p>They have moved away&mdash;it was a prudent step.</p>

<p>Now that they are gone, I could almost wish that I
were dead!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noblesse Oblige.</i></p>

<p>The young English <em>sportmans</em> is, after all, a good
infant. He brings me a big goblet and a biscuit, which
comfort me, and tries to speak to me in French.</p>

<p>Words sympathetic, but mysterious.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, Monsieur</i>,” he says, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il faut décidément maintenir
votre pivert</i>!”</p>

<p>Enigma! “I must keep up my wood-pecker?” I <em>have</em>
no wood-pecker! I tell him so in his own tongue; adding
that I am very fond of shooting at the doves.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he rejoins, “we don’t call ’em Doves, we call
’em <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les hiboux du coiffeur</i>&mdash;Barbers’ Owls!”</p>

<p>We become more and more friendly, as the pain subsides.
When we reach Douvres, I give him my card.</p>

<p>He says that he has forgotten his; but that I shall have
no difficulty in finding him at any of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tambours de la
chasse</i>&mdash;Sporting Drums&mdash;especially if I ask for Lord
William Wiggins, of Wapping.</p>

<p>What a droll of a name! Not facile to pronounce, that!
Let us essay, with the help of the dictionary of pronunciation:</p>

<p>“Ouilliam Ouiggins&mdash;of Ouapping.”</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> <i>The Babylon of Britain.</i></p>

<p>Yes: in England everything is great. Behold this
London, confused and chaotic amalgamation of bourg upon
bourg, of city upon city, almost of county upon county&mdash;behold
its administration, vague, contradictory, without
doubt, but immense, but Titanic, but sublime.</p>

<p>To-day London has but one heart, which palpitates&mdash;one
thought, which engrosses&mdash;one dream, which possesses&mdash;one
hope, which enchants. To the heart, the thought,
the dream, the hope, there is one key.</p>

<p>It is the Epsom’s Courses, at Derby!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> <i>Explications.</i></p>

<p>Questions to resolve:</p>

<p>“Who is Epsom?”</p>

<p>“And where is Derby?”</p>

<p>Mystery strange and inexplicable, this Epsom! Not
one of my interlocutors, of French or English, can give
me any particulars of his life. Oh fame, oh renown, oh
fickleness of popular affection! We go to the Courses he
has founded; and yet the very day of his death is forgotten
or unknown!</p>

<p>Another mystery. Derby is a hundred and twenty miles
from London; and yet many of my friends assure that they
will drive down without a single change of horses! Ah,
then, it is no marvel, this predominance of the old England
in the hippic arena, when even the ordinary horses of the
carriage can travel a hundred and twenty miles&mdash;two
hundred kilomètres&mdash;without fatigue.</p>

<p>These facts were new to me. They were also new to
most of my countrymen with whom I conversed.</p>

<p>The Unknown&mdash;behold the Redoubtable!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vieille Ecole, Bonne Ecole</i>.</p>

<p>Happily, I encounter Lord Ouiggins.</p>

<p>He is an aristocrat of the old rock&mdash;a little mocking,
perchance, a little reserved, cold, indifferent, proud, but
of an antique probity, a disinterestedness more than
Roman.</p>

<p>He takes me under his charge.</p>

<p><em>I had been deceived.</em> They were mocking themselves of
me, those who told me the courses were at Derby. They
are run on Epsom’s Salt-Downs.</p>

<p>“Derby” is only the title of their founder, one of those
English eccentrics of whom the type is so familiar in
France&mdash;poet, politician, jockey&mdash;Premier Minister of Great
Britain until he was overthrown by the intrigues of Sir
Benjamin Gladstone!</p>

<p>After one thunder-stroke, another:</p>

<p><em>Gladiateur is not to run!</em></p>

<p>Is <em>this</em>, then, the old Britannic chivalry&mdash;the love of
what the poet has proudly called “Greenwich Fair-Play”?
Is <em>this</em> the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i>? I survey Lord Ouiggins. He
can scarcely meet my eye. He turns aside.</p>

<p>Let us hope it is to blush!</p>

<p>He tries to defend the invidious exclusion. He pretends
that in the Derby-Course the horses must not exceed a
certain age; also that Gladiateur was at least quite
sufficiently near that age when he <em>did</em> run. Puerile evasion!
False pride of nationality!</p>

<p>What is to become of the money I have wagered?</p>

<p>Lord Ouiggins tells me to console myself. <em>He has private
information.</em> He will not see a foreign gentleman
wronged.</p>

<p class="p2 center">X. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Nuits de Londres.</i></p>

<p>We are inseparable.</p>

<p>Milord has backed a favourite to win him thousands of
sterlings.</p>

<p>Curious, almost cynical nomenclature of the Turf!</p>

<p><span class="pageno">246</span>
The horse is named Ventre-Tambour, Bellydrum!!</p>

<p>He is assured to win; Milord dreamt, last night, that
he saw him four lengths ahead at Tattenham-court-road
Corner.</p>

<p>I wager freely on Ventre-Tambour.</p>

<p>Lord Ouiggins says we had better not go down to his
baronial hall at Ouapping, but “make a night” and start
early.</p>

<p>Ah, nights of London, you have not, effectively, stolen
your reputation! What contrasts, fascinating but terrible&mdash;here,
the noblesse, like Ouiggins quaffing champagne
with visitors from France; and there the miserables, the
Tom-Dick-Harries drinking gin&mdash;the blonde misses, casting
aside the Puritanic pudor of the saloon, and dancing
freely with foreign <em>gentlemans</em> at the Duke of Argyle’s
Casino&mdash;what contrasts, but also, alas, what jealousies
still existing, what internecine hatred still in rage!</p>

<p>That the English should hate the Irish is but natural.</p>

<p>We always hate those whom we have wronged!</p>

<p>It is less reasonable that they should continue to hate
the children of Cambria, with whom they have been so long
in friendly union.</p>

<p>And yet, more than once during this exciting evening,
I have heard Lord Ouiggins spoken of&mdash;my patrician <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pur
sang</i>&mdash;as a Welsher, with evident contempt.</p>

<p>Brutal antipathies unworthy of the century!</p>

<p>They shall have no influence on the mind of a son of
France.</p>

<p>“Lord Ouilliam,” I exclaimed, “regard them not!
Generous compatriot of Llewellyn, I pledge thee in another
bumper to the victory of Ventre-Tambour!”</p>

<p>After Light, Shadow; after Pleasure, Pain; sad but
inevitable oscillations of the pendulum of life!</p>

<p>Alas, to wake&mdash;it is to remember, and to remember is to
repent.</p>

<p>Last night, I banqueted with the merchant-princes of
London and with the ancient nobility of Wales; the
leaders of the Fashion World, the Sport, the Turf, the
boxers of the most renowned, the comics of the musical
saloons&mdash;Lord Ouiggins signalised them all to me. Foaming,
sparkling, vivacious, the wines of Champagne led the
way for the stronger Grogs. A vision, confused indeed,
but magnificent in its confusion, will long recall to me the
night before the Derby.</p>

<p>I awoke.</p>

<p>Sad and supreme moment of mortality when awakening
means isolation!</p>

<p>For some time, I knew not where I found myself. Presently,
as the dim light of the dawn penetrated, first
through the folds of the fog, and next through the dirt of the
windows, I recollected that Lord Ouiggins had advised me
to stay with him at a fashionable hotel, adding that his
own drag would call for us in the morning.</p>

<p>It was still of a good hour. I turned myself to sleep;
but heard, with dreamy ears, the fall&mdash;or so it seemed&mdash;of
cataracts of rain, around me, beside me, overhead. The
sound gave me a strange sensation of thirst, which I cannot
otherwise explain.</p>

<p>Instinctively, I rang the bell, and shouted “Selters!
Selters! Selters!”</p>

<p>A tap at my door; and Lord Ouilliam, in half-toilette,
appeared. I saluted him.</p>

<p>“Is it that the rain will make to be deferred the
Courses?”</p>

<p>“What rain?”</p>

<p>“Listen, then!”</p>

<p>“<em>That?</em> Why, it’s only the men tubbing!” (Idiom
untranslatable.)</p>

<p>“What did you ring for?” pursued Lord Ouilliam.</p>

<p>“But, for Selters then!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout droit.</i>” he rejoined. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous etiez horriblement
coupé, mon ami; bien roide!</i>”</p>

<p>Strange and picturesque <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">argot</i> of intoxication: “awfully
cut,” “very tight.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” continued Milord, “My carriage is not yet
arrived. It has probably been stopped by the Thames
Embankment, which is to run outside my park at Ouapping.
Look you, I will take places for two, outside an omnibus.
It is the usual plan amongst nobility. Admiral Rous will
be one of us. You may easily know him by his wearing a
white hat, a veil, and a flower in his button-hole. Meanwhile,
better not have Selters. Try S. and B!”</p>

<p>Enigma, of which the solution&mdash;when it came&mdash;was far
from disagreeable.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <i>Lux.</i></p>

<p>The morning at first was dull and brumous. The <i>spleen</i>
of Britannia seemed to possess me. I had atrocious pains
in my head. Every noise bore upon my nerves. The very
sight of food seemed to nauseate me.</p>

<p>Lord Ouiggins, on the contrary, made a breakfast of the
most substantial.</p>

<p>I cannot say much in favour of the cuisine at this fashionable
hotel, one of the first in London, the well-known
“Spotted Dog” in the aristocratic quarter. Route de la
Chapelle Blanche (White-Chapel-road), the Faubourg <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Germain of London. Strange: the hotel is not mentioned
in any of the ordinary London Guides.</p>

<p>We take our places. The best seat is reserved for the
Admiral&mdash;that famous old warrior, who turned the fortune
of the day at Chillianwallah by his historical charge at the
head of the Naval Reserve and the Royal Horse Marines.
Combination eccentric, but not without precedent. The
horse was sacred to Neptunus. This Rous, see you, this
Admiral so passionately equine in his tastes, he is Jean-Bart
and he is also Murat; he is Kellermann and he is
also La Pérouse! All the great men touch, and recognise
one another!</p>

<p>The light still brightens. Behold us then effectively
departed!</p>

<p>Hourrah! Hep, hep, hep!</p>

<p>Vive Ventre-Tambour!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <i>Nothing is Certain to Happen but that which is
Unforeseen.</i></p>

<p>We have gone a few miles on our road, still through the
streets of the fashionable quarter, to-day as democratic as
the Faubourg <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antoine, and crowded with other
Derbyites, before we speak much to each other. Reserve
characteristic of the oldest and proudest aristocracy on
earth.</p>

<p>At length Lord Ouiggins whispers me&mdash;</p>

<p>“I knew I had forgotten <em>something</em>. I’ve left my purse
on the piano!”</p>

<p>For the moment I wished that I had done the same.</p>

<p>Suspicion dishonouring and ignoble!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si Jeunesse Savait.</i></p>

<p>Fog, obscurity, cold&mdash;yes, you will find them all in the
climate of Great Britain; in England, in Scotland, in
Ireland, and in the mountains of Wales, the cradle of Lord
Ouilliam! It is true, but it is not the only verity. Great
Britain also has her moments of fine weather. There are
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
no such trees in the world as the tall poplars of my own,
my beautiful France&mdash;none planted in such mathematical,
such symmetrical order, so methodical, logical, and straight.
Nevertheless, Nature is infinite. Even the chestnuts,
hawthorns, lilacs, and laburnums of the Surrey lanes are
not absolutely offensive to the eye. To-day, also, Phœbus
pierces. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lux!</i></p>

<p>There are no women in the world like those of Paris;
but there is still a pleasant freshness in the faces of the
young pensionaries who watch us, at times, over garden
walls. To several of these, I kiss my hand. They smile
in reply. Laugh, rosy daughters of Albion, laugh; for it is
still day, and you are young&mdash;too young for reverie.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> <i>When Poverty becomes ironical, let Wealth take care.</i></p>

<p>The old Britannic <em>humour</em>, as exhibited in Samuel
Benjamin Jonson, in Jonathan Smith, and Dean Sydney
Swift, is not absolutely extinct upon the road.</p>

<p>More than one little Arab of the highway shouts out to
me, “I’ll have your hat!” Wild caprice of the imagination,
playfully misrepresenting the probable eventualities
of the future, and yet, at bottom, profound, almost
terrible&mdash;a mockery, yes, but a menace&mdash;a jest, without
doubt, but a threat also&mdash;the voice, grotesque but strident,
of the Miserables.</p>

<p>I impart the reflections to Lord Ouiggins. Alas, to what
good? The pride of his class is too strong for him. His
natural instincts are noble; but he is spoiled by the
mephitic atmosphere of the Upper Chamber. With a
laugh cold, sardonic, and glacial, he <span class="lock">replies:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Throw the little beggar a copper, and let him go!”</p>

<p>He does not even, generous though he is, offer to provide
the copper.</p>

<p>Again, ignoble suspicion! I forget that he has left his
purse on the piano!</p>

<p>The Arab&mdash;delirious with joy&mdash;saved, perhaps, from
starvation by the casual bounty of a foreign <em>sportmans</em>,
would fain express his thanks. His emotion overpowers
him. He staggers; horror, he falls! No! again! Gallant
child of Poverty, the struggle is vain. Once more he wavers,
he oscillates, he falls, and turning wildly head over heels,
in the convulsion of his death agony, he disappears in a
cloud of dust&mdash;doubtless to be driven over by the omnibuses
of the haughty, and the phaetons of the Stock Exchange!</p>

<p>Shocked, but masking my horror under the veil of a
politeness a little cynical I say to Lord Ouiggins.</p>

<p>“And well, then, Milord, did you see what he did? and
do you know what will be his fate?”</p>

<p>Question terrible!</p>

<p>He does not even remove the cigar from his mouth, this
impassive patrician, as he answers, with a laconism which
lacerates, which vibrates on my nerves, which almost
makes me bound.</p>

<p>“<em>Yes; cart-wheel!</em>”</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> <i>London at Epsom.</i></p>

<p>Dust, heat, emotion&mdash;all stimulate thirst.</p>

<p>I soon forget the little Arab. There are plenty of others
remaining! There are worse things in the world, too, than
bottled stout. Lord Ouilliam tells me that none of the
aristocracy now drink champagne in public. It excites a
feeling of envy among the lower orders. On Derby’s Day,
the populace gives the tone to the peerage.</p>

<p>The crowd; my faith, and what a crowd! There are
two things in the world which a man never forgets: his
first sight of the sea, and his first sight of the multitude
on Epsom Downs!</p>

<p>What a sound, as of ocean! What infinite discords,
subdued, by very force of number and of contradiction, into
one sublime monotone! What minstrelsy, cosmopolitan
and comprehensive&mdash;the audible expression of a Colonial
System unparalleled in grandeur and extent! The Hindoo
may think in his heart of the days when he fought for his
country’s municipal freedom under the banner of Rammohun
Roy and Nana Sahib; but look! Plaintively
submissive, he strikes his <em>tom-tom</em> to amuse the destroyers
of his race.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the horses a little nearer?”
says Lord Ouiggins. “You had better buy a couple of
tickets for the Padwick.” I do so. The Padwick&mdash;so
called of an eminent British <em>sportmans</em>&mdash;is an enclosed
space in which the true connoisseurs survey the horses
before they start. As I gaze at Ventre-Tambour, I can
hardly refrain from shouting, amongst all these impassible
patricians, “Hourrah! Hep, hep, hep!”</p>

<p>Lord Ouilliam Ouiggins comes to me, hurriedly, and
whispers, “Hush, <cite>I have just got the straight tip from the
Admiral himself</cite>. It’s a moral; and the horse at twenty-five
to one! We must get on every sov. we have. There
is barely time before they start. Quick.” I hand him my
purse&mdash;not without a moment of hesitation&mdash;of which I
am speedily ashamed.</p>

<p>A minute sometimes seems like hours. Fortune was in

<p>The interval of suspense was horrible; and yet its
termination, when it <em>did</em> come, seemed abrupt, sudden,
incredible.</p>

<p>I was still struggling with the crowd, when a hoarse
sound suddenly rose like the roar of a tempest on a rocky
coast&mdash;it rose, and rose, and grew stronger; I looked; I
saw a wonderful white flash of faces as the heads of the
multitude turned all, in one instant, one way; and my
pulses seemed as though they would kill me with their
throbbing as, with one voice, that innumerable assemblage

<p>She was lost! In this world nothing is lost. It is only
mislaid. <em>She</em> was Miss Lade: yet she was lost! Where
was she? She was in London. London is in England.
It is a great city&mdash;as large as Paris! It is as hard to
discover a person in London as “to find a needle in a
bottle of hay.” This is an English phrase. They bottle
hay, and rack it, like wine! It is made into chaff. The
people are fond of chaff. The Scotchman lives on oats,
the Irishman on potatoes, the Englishman on chaff.</p>

<p>Tom Harry sought her. He wanted to marry her!
He hoped she also wanted Tom Harry. But he had lost
her. He knew she was in London, therefore he was in
London. He inquired of many. They gave him chaff.
He could not find the needle in it. <em>She</em> was his
needle. He was a Pole&mdash;an English naturalized Pole.
He would stick at nothing to find her. They were true
to each other as Needle and Pole! but were now as far
apart as two Poles!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Chapter <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum Grano Salis.</i></p>

<p>The world is always large. Society is small. But Tom
Harry and Miss Lade were in the world. They were not
in Society! He had to seek her <em>out</em> of Society. Endeavour
to catch a globule of mercury in a drawer. It flies&mdash;it
escapes&mdash;it separates into atoms&mdash;it joins again and
rolls away&mdash;it is lost&mdash;it is found&mdash;it is never secured!
It eludes you&mdash;it is a demon&mdash;a wild spirit that vanishes
as you think you grasp it! So was Miss Lade to Tom
Harry! He thought that he saw her&mdash;but she became
invisible! He could not find her. She found herself&mdash;it
was in furnished apartments!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Chapter</span> <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>&mdash;<i>Arithmetic.</i></p>

<p>He had a clue! But what was a clue in so wild a maze
as the great London? In Paris the police would have
found her, In London there were, at that time, no police.
They were “reserved forces,” and had been called out in
case of war! When so used there are no police. The
authorities then make constables of the prisoners. It is
a maxim of English law, “Set a thief to catch a thief.”
But Miss Lade was not a thief&mdash;except that she had
stolen the heart of Tom Harry! This was not a legal
felony&mdash;therefore the police could not catch her! The
clue was a piece of paper found in her room in Paris. On
it was written the number “31” and “London.” That
was all!</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Chapter</span> <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>&mdash;<i>Circumambient.</i></p>

<p>How to find this number 31? That was the problem.
Tom Harry had graduated at Oxford&mdash;not Cambridge.
This was the error! A Cambridge man would have been
able to calculate the probabilities, and obtained a result.
Tom Harry had to discover her equation. She was X
(an unknown quantity). He was A, but he was also&mdash;C
(that is minus cash)! The postulate was that A - C + B =
X. What was the B in the equation?&mdash;probably a book.
What book?&mdash;decidedly a London directory! He bought
one. It is a large book&mdash;a heavy one! He could not
carry it&mdash;yet it was a necessary work of reference. Difficulties
must be conquered. Man was made to overcome
them! Tom Harry succeeded! He purchased a “single”
perambulator&mdash;not a “double”&mdash;one they double up!
The leaves of the directory were doubled down. Therefore
the perambulator and the book were in accord! He
wheel’d about his book. It was his child!&mdash;he had bought
it! They allow this in England, where they sell wives at
Smithfield! He found his way about. This child was
his guide! Is not childhood the very best and purest
guide to manhood? and does not manhood only lead us
into a second childhood? But among all the numbers
“thirty-one,” he had not found her! He was in a fog.
She was mist. He was in a London fog! It was dark
and thick as Erebus! But he could not see e’er a “bus.”
They could not run; nor could he. He had lost Miss
Lade&mdash;he had now lost himself? He asked a sweeper of
crossings where was he? He was told that he was at the
corner of the Park of Hyde! It was true.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Chapter</span> <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>&mdash;<i>What Happens is Always the Unforeseen.</i></p>

<p>There are dark periods in the history of nations. It is
the same with individuals. It was so with Tom Harry.
He was at the Park of Hyde&mdash;at one corner of it! It was
a place to hide in&mdash;hence the name. Was <em>she</em> hidden
there? It was a natural thought. He would search it,
and would find her! But how? He knew not the way!
Here steps in Fate, which governs all things. It was a
policeman! There were only two left of the reserves&mdash;one
to guard the Tower, where the Queen resides; the
other in charge of Constitution Hill, which is by the
corner of Hyde Park. Under ordinary circumstances
the police of London are not permitted to talk. They are
only allowed to say, “Move on!” This is the Englishman’s
watchword! The Americans have the same, in
effect; they say, “Go ahead!” The policeman in charge
of Constitution Hill was absolved from this rule by an
Order in Council. It was an important office. The
preservation of the Queen and Constitution (which is
kept on the Hill named from it) is of the greatest national
consequence. Therefore the policeman was a high official,
and allowed to speak. Tom Harry addressed him,
explaining his position and quest for Miss Lade. The
policeman pointed to his collar and the figures on it,
exclaimed&mdash;“I am number ‘31’! Miss Lade lodges
with my wife!” The clue was right! She was found!</p>

<p>On January 24, 1885, the following announcement
appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">It being reported that Victor Hugo has just purchased
for the sum of £13,000 a piece of land in the immediate
vicinity of his present abode, with a view of building on it
an entirely new house “of his own designing,” the following
extract from a preliminary letter of instructions to
the contractor who has undertaken the work will be read
with interest.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p class="blockquote">“You will ask me whether I am an Architect; and I
reply to you, ‘An Architect is one who constructs.’ Do
I construct? Yes. What? Never mind; let us proceed.
To construct a house you require a basement.
This is the language of the Contractor. But the Poet
meets him with a rejoinder. A basement is a prison,
and Liberty can not breathe through a grating. This
was the case at the Bastille! What has been done at the
Bastille does not repeat itself. What then? You will
commence the house on the first floor.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">Does this stagger the Architect? Unquestionably!
Yet to commence a house on the first-floor is easy enough.
To the Contractor? No. To the Poet? Yes. How?
By a flight. Two flights will take anyone somewhere.
Upstairs? Yes. Downstairs? Certainly! In my lady’s
chamber? Why not? This is a phenomenon, and surprises
you. Just now you were on the stare. Now you
are on the first-floor landing. Therefore, you have taken
a rise. Out of whom&mdash;the Architect? Possibly. Let
us resume.</p>

<p class="blockquote">And now for the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="blockquote">This will be colossal. Why? Because the furniture
in it will be stupendous. To talk of stupendous furniture
is to suggest the opening scene of a Pantomime. A big
head! Whose? No matter. But you will inquire as to
this furniture. You will probably say, ‘Will there be
chairs?’ No. ‘Arm-chairs?’ Useless. ‘Sofas with six
legs?’ A phantom! ‘What then? Canopied thrones for
four-and-twenty, with one of a superior make and quality?’
Quite so. ‘Why?’ Because it is here that Genius, after
dinner, will meet the Kings and Emperors that aspire to
pay it homage. ‘Will there be windows?’ Rather&mdash;and
there is this convenient thing besides&mdash;eight-and-forty balconies.
You will say at once, ‘Two a-piece?’ But you
will quickly add&mdash;‘What of the gardens beneath?’ To
this there is only one answer possible&mdash;‘Fireworks!’</p>

<p class="blockquote">Roman candles, rockets, and Bengal lights? No.&mdash;A
set piece? Yes. Representing what? Somebody! Now
there is this advantage about a set-piece that represents
somebody&mdash;if carefully prepared, regardless of expense, and
covering an area of 90 feet by 120. It may be permanent.
Some one whispers ‘Advertisement.’ To this I make a
supreme reply, ‘Fame!’</p>

<p class="blockquote">And now let us pass to another room. Shall we put our
foot in it? Yes. Why? Because it is the kitchen.</p>

once in three hundred and sixty-five days was not too often.
An octopus&mdash;a devil fish&mdash;was watching him. Man and
monster, they eyed each other. Gaillard trembled at its
glance&mdash;he was not brave. I saw it once, and did not
tremble; I am brave. It was at the Aquarium. The
octopus has eight legs; Gaillard wished for eighty, but his
two sufficed. Fear gave them the swiftness of two hundred.
He ran. You would have run. Should I have done so?
Everything is possible. It is possible I should have run.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Cat.</span></p>

<p>The cat is the concrete symbol of a vacillating politician.</p>

<p>It is always on the fence.</p>

<p>It is the feline embodiment of one of the profoundest
human principles wrenched from the circumambience of the
Unknown, and hurled into the bosom of consciousness.</p>

<p>Nine tailors make one man. The cat has nine times the
life of one man, for it has nine lives. Possession, also, is
nine points of the law. Behold a legal possession of existence
equal to the span of eighty-one clothiers’ lives.</p>

<p>Let us bow reverently before this august fact.</p>

<p>The wanderer by the midnight seashore, when the moon&mdash;that
argent cornucopia of heaven&mdash;is streaming forth her
flowers and fruits of radiance, and the illimitable is illuminated
by the ineffable, will have remarked the phosphorescent
ridges that scintillate along the billows’ tops, until the
breakers seem to curve and snort like horses’ necks with
manes of lightning clad.</p>

<p>So, O man, when in the darkness of thine own chamber,
thou passeth thine hand along the furry spine of this feline
phantom of the back yard, the electric sparks dart forth,
and a flash of lightning fuses together the fingers and the
fur.</p>

<p>Exquisite antithesis of Nature! The fireside embraces
the ocean. The hearthstone is paved with seashells. The
monsters of the deep disport, reflected in the glowing embers.
The infinite Abroad is brought into amalgamation with the
finite at Home.</p>

<p>The ocean roars.</p>

<p>The cat only purrs.</p>

<p>The billows rise and culminate and break.</p>

<p><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
The cat’s back rises. The feline tide is up, and we have
a permanent billow of fur and flesh.</p>

<p>O impossible co-existence of uncontradictory contradictions!</p>

<p>The duke of Wellington <em>was</em> pronounced the greatest
captain of his age. Gen. Grant <em>is</em> pronounced the greatest
captain of his.</p>

<p>The greatest captain of any age was the captain with his
whiskers.</p>

<p>Let us not call this the tergiversation of history. Call it
rather the tergiversation of nature.</p>

<p>The whiskers of the captain.</p>

<p>The whiskers of the cat.</p>

<p>The hirsute exponent of martial supremacy. The feline
symbolism of the Bearded Lady, crossing her claws before
the family fire.</p>

<p>Jealousy has been called the green-eyed monster.</p>

<p>The cat is the green-eyed monster.</p>

<p>Both lie in wait. Neither destroys its victim without
toying with it. One is the foe, the other the friend, of the
fireside. Either is to be met with in almost every family.
Each is of both sexes.</p>

<p>“Old Tom” gin, in excess, is one of man’s bitterest
bibulous foes; man is the bitterest bibulous foe of old tom
cats.</p>

<p>Osculations between sky and earth! O lips of the
Seen touching the lips of the Unseen! O wave of thought
careering through the asymptotes of cloudland, crystalizing
into angelic foci the tangents of humanity.</p>

<p>The stars are out at night.</p>

<p>So are cats!</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">A MANIFESTO BY HICTOR VUGO</p>

<p>We live and move and have our being. By we I express
civilisation, which consists first of Paris, then the world at
large. We are born with generous instincts. We are
naturally humane. I call upon the French Revolution of
’92-3 to prove this theory. We cannot all be Arabis. That
would be too supreme a dream. But we can all admire him
at a distance. Those horrible <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</i> the English have
warred against a weak race of striplings, descendants of the
glorious mummies. They have fought, and aided by the
magnificent single-minded abstinent France have won.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon dieu!</i> Why was I not there? With one impassioned
foot firmly planted on the escarpment of Tel-el-Kebir, I
would have kept these British brutes at bay. I would have
quoted one of my rhythmic poems, and they would have
piled arms, awe-stricken and listened. Or, perhaps, these
island savages in their ignorance, would have shot me.
They are sufficiently unrefined for that. Ah! the thought
is too dreadful. France, my beloved France, would in such
a case have died also, for with me will perish all the ideas
which go to make a great race&mdash;Adolphe, bring me a cigarette
and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café noir</i>. I would be calm.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>By Alexandre Dumas.</cite></p>

<p>This parody, which is to be found in Bret Harte’s
<cite>Sensation Novels Condensed</cite> is an ingenious mixture of
“The Three Musqueteers” and “The Vicomte de
Bragelonne.”</p>

<p>The second chapter is the <span class="lock">best:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Chapter <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span></p>

<p class="center sc lowercase ls">THE COMBAT.</p>

<p>On leaving Provins the first musketeer proceeded to
Nangis, where he was reinforced by thirty-three followers.
The second musketeer, arriving at Nangis at the same
moment, placed himself at the head of thirty-three more.
The third guest of the landlord of Provins arrived at
Nangis in time to assemble together thirty-three other
musketeers.</p>

<p>The first stranger led the troops of his Eminence.</p>

<p>The second led the troops of the Queen.</p>

<p>The third led the troops of the King.</p>

<p>The fight commenced. It raged terribly for seven hours.
The first musketeer killed thirty of the Queen’s troops.
The second musketeer killed thirty of the King’s troops.
The third musketeer killed thirty of his Eminence’s troops.</p>

<p>By this time it will be perceived the number of musketeers
had been narrowed down to four on each side.</p>

<p>Naturally the three principal warriors approached each
other.</p>

<p>They simultaneously uttered a cry:</p>

<p>“Aramis!”</p>

<p>“Athos!”</p>

<p>“D’Artagnan!”</p>

<p>They fell into each others arms.</p>

<p>“And it seems that we are fighting against each other,
my children,” said the Count de la Fere, mournfully.</p>

<p>“How singular!” exclaimed Aramis and D’Artagnan.</p>

<p>“Let us stop this fratricidal warfare,” said Athos.</p>

<p>“We will!” they exclaimed together.</p>

<p>“But how to disband our followers?” queried
D’Artagnan.</p>

<p>Aramis winked. They understood each other. “Let
us cut ’em down!”</p>

<p>They cut ’em down. Aramis killed three. D’Artagnan
three. Athos three.</p>

<p>The friends again embraced. “How like old times!”
said Aramis. “How touching!” exclaimed the serious and
philosophic Count de la Fere.</p>

<p>The galloping of hoofs caused them to withdraw from
each other’s embraces. A gigantic figure rapidly approached.</p>

<p>“The innkeeper of Provins!” they cried, drawing their
swords.</p>

<p>“Perigord, down with him!” shouted D’Artagnan.</p>

<p>“Stay,” said Athos.</p>

<p>The gigantic figure was beside them. He uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“Athos, Aramis, D’Artagnan!”</p>

<p>“Porthos!” exclaimed the astonished trio.</p>

<p>“The same.” They all fell in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>The Count de la Fere slowly raised his hands to Heaven.
“Bless you! Bless us, my children! However different
our opinions may be in regard to politics, we have but one
opinion in regard to our own merits. Where can you find a
better man than Aramis?”</p>

<p>“Than Porthos?” said Aramis.</p>

<p>“Than D’Artagnan?” said Porthos.</p>

<p>“Than Athos?” said D’Artagnan.</p>

<p><cite>Viator.</cite> Whither away, Master? A good morning to
you! I have stretched my legs to catch the train to Tottenham
and here I find you with rod and basket, as of old.</p>

<p><cite>Piscator.</cite> Faith, Scholar, I have even been too long an
angler with Nero, in the lake of darkness, and would fain
take a chub, Tottenham way, and see mine old haunts.</p>

<p><cite>Viator.</cite> Then have with you, Master; and I do mind me
of pretty Maudlin that hereabouts would sing us, “<cite>Come,
Shepherds, deck your heads!</cite>”</p>

<p><cite>Piscator.</cite> Ay, Scholar, methinks Maudlin was the Siren
that led thee to the River Lea more than all my wisdom.
But here we are got to Tottenham, and to the waterside.</p>

<p><cite>Viator.</cite> Oh, oh, Master, what place is this, and what
smell cometh to my nostrils? See, see, Master, here be no
chub, but two dead dogs and one departed cat!</p>

<p><cite>Piscator.</cite> In sooth, Scholar, the country seemeth strange,
and no man may live, nor fish neither, hard by such an
open sewer. Can this be the Lea! Nay, Scholars, this is
no place for honest anglers more. But hither walks Corydon.
Let us ask him what makes this blackness in the water, and
the smell that abides here, as they say frankincense and
myrrh do cling, more sweetly, to the shores of the blessed
Arabia. What ho, Corydon, what cheer?</p>

<p><cite>Corydon.</cite><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span> Sir, the condition of the River Lea is something
really fearful. From Tottenham downwards the water
is a mere open sewer, emitting the most noxious exhalations.
Boating and bathing have ceased, and the River is now only
a danger to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><cite>Piscator.</cite> Say you so? And what maketh that it should
be so?</p>

<p><cite>Corydon.</cite> Ah, Master, the drainage of Tottenham is
turned bodily into the stream, and, in spite of Local Boards,
the nuisance continues unaltered.</p>

<p><cite>Piscator.</cite> And why right they not this wrong; for, marry,
the poor folk here will die, and a pestilence be bred, if ye
live not more cleanly.</p>

<p><cite>Corydon.</cite> Sir, no man knows this better than the Tottenham
Authorities themselves, who cause a horrible, disgusting
nuisance to the dwellers on the Lea. They simply sow
disease broadcast among thousands of helpless people, to
save the expenditure of a certain sum of money.</p>

<p><cite>Piscator.</cite> Penny wise, and pound foolish&mdash;penny wise,
and pound foolish! Soon shall we have the Great Plague here
again, and none to blame but the chuckled-headed “Authorities,”
my Masters! Come away, Scholars, come away.
The silver Lea is bedraggled. ’Tis no place for peaceful
ghosts, that would be quiet, and go a-fishing.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">LORD LYTTON.</p>

<p>In Volume <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> of this Collection, (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 222)
parodies upon Lord Lytton’s Poems and Plays
were given, burlesques upon his prose works
remain to be noted.</p>

<p>Praises of the Ideal, the Beautiful, the
True, and the Virtuous, abound in Lord
Lytton’s Novels, of which desirable qualities
his own life and character were singularly
destitute.</p>

<p>Tennyson satirised him as a fop, whilst Thackeray
treated him with well-merited ridicule and contempt, both in
the “Epistles to the Literati,” and in “Novels by Eminent
Hands.” The latter series originally appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>,
and the parody of Lytton was entitled “George de
Barnwell.” In this, a paltry thief and murderer was
elevated into a hero, in much the same manner that Lytton
had treated Eugene Aram.</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary to give any extract from this well-known
and accessible burlesque.</p>

<p>In connection with Thackeray’s well-known burlesque
criticism on <cite>The Sea Captain</cite> by Lord Lytton (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 225. <abbr title="Volume Five">Vol.
V.</abbr>) it should be mentioned that when that play was reproduced
at the Lyceum Theatre under the lessee-ship of
Mr. E. T. Smith, a continuation of Thackeray’s criticism
appeared in <cite>The Mask</cite>, London, November 1868.</p>

<p>In this Thackeray’s style and orthography were mimicked,
and Mr. Bandmann, who took the part of the prating hero
<i>Vivyan</i>, was severely criticised for his stagey acting.</p>

<p><cite>The Sea Captain</cite> had been damned in 1839, and <cite>The
Rightful Heir</cite> scarcely merited a better fate, but it gave
rise to a splendid burlesque, <cite>The Frightful Hair</cite>, by
F. C. Burnand produced at The Haymarket Theatre, in
December 1868, with Compton, Kendal, and Miss Ione
Burke in the Cast.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Diamond Death.</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>By Sir Pelham Little Bulwer, Bart.</cite></p>

<p>Alphonsine Fleury, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">modiste</i> of Paris, determined that she
should die. And, all things considered, it was hardly
wonderful that the pretty little girl should come to such a
conclusion. Poor child. Fickle woman! Thou hast
hardly known Life these eighteen winters, and, yet,
would’st be already toying with his brother Death! Die,
then, child, if such be thy will. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Facilis descensus Averni.</i></p>

<p>Everybody must admit that she had reason. She called
him her lover, that false and whiskered Jules, hero of the
barricades, best polker at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chaumière</i>. And he had
sworn to love her, and perhaps he meant it. For between
Truth and Falsehood, there lies the Paradise of the
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
Purposeless (shrouded, as the Doric poets sing, in a sapphire
cloud), and <em>there</em> are kept the vows which expire on earth
for lack of the vivifying presence of the undying Earnest.</p>

<p>Jules was false, and Alphonsine would die. But when
one has decided on doing a thing, one has still to decide on
the way of doing it. And in regard to dying, one ought
really to be careful; because (so far as one sees) there is no
way, if one does it awkwardly, of repairing the blunder.
The Biggest can die but once. There ran the Seine, and
the Pont-Neuf was toll-less, which was a consideration, as
Alphonsine’s last <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sou</i> had gone to purchase her last roll.
But the Seine was so muddy, and then the Morgue, and its
wet marble. The poor child shuddered at the thought.
And the costume, too, for she was French, and, moreover,
had instinctive delicacy. Clearly not the Seine.</p>

<p>The towers of Notre Dame. Better, certainly; and she
would go rushing into the arms of Death, with a heart
full of Victor Hugo, Peer of France. But no! Why, she
had been quite ill going down one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">montagnes Russes</i>
at the last carnival, even though Jules had held her in the
car. She would never be able to look down from the giant
tower. Could it shake its grim head and hurl her quivering
away, it might be done. But a leap thence! M. D.
Lamartine himself never dreamed of such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chute d’un ange</i>.</p>

<p>Poison. But Jules had taken her to see Frederic
Lemaitre, poisoned by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Dame de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tropez</i>. His
contortions under the arsenic&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quel horreur</i>! There would
be nobody to see her make faces, certainly, but what of
that? Is one to lose all self-respect because one is going
to kill oneself? Alphonsine’s mind rejected the poison.</p>

<p>It should be charcoal. Certainly, charcoal. Alphonsine
would die like a Countess who had betrayed her husband,
gambled away her fortune, and found a pimple on her
nose. It was a lady’s death; and Alphonsine, a skilful
little milliner, had been among ladies until she had taken
measure of their minds as well as of their waists. So she
would leave the world gracefully, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</i>.</p>

<p>Glow, thou ebon incense for the Altar of Doom; glow in
thy little censer there beside her, in other days the lid of
her saucepan. Glow, for there lies the poor child, Bride of
Death, expectant of her Bridegroom. She has arrayed her
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mansarde</i> so neatly, that, when the rough <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commissaires de
Police</i> force the door, they will pause upon the threshold&mdash;perhaps
touch their hats. And she lies with clasped hands,
and upon her maiden bosom rests a daguerreotype of her
faithless lover. Glow, dark charcoal, glow, and let thy
fames waft her spirit from this cold world, to realms where
Anteros smiles upon the True and the Beautiful.</p>

<p>She is dying. But, O kindly Mother of the Dead, thou
sendest through the Portal of Ivory a gentle Dream.
Through the closing eyes of Alphonsine that Dream looks
forth, and its look falls upon that glowing censer, which
glares like the eye of a Demon. Full into that Demon-eye
looks the Dream, unscared, and what sees it there?
Alphonsine dreams that a mighty and a pitying Voice hath
come forth from the Treasure-house of Fate, and hath said
unto that fiery charcoal, <span class="sc">Be as thou wert wont to be</span>.</p>

<p>The modest charcoal knows its Lord, and blushes. Then,
suddenly paling its fires, they soften into crystal light; and
as they subside, the charcoal glitters in its other and more
glorious form, the <span class="sc">Diamond</span>! Countless treasures roll at
the feet of the expiring Alphonsine. * * *</p>

<p>Expiring?&mdash;Oh, no! The world has rose-joy for her
yet. Jules, repentant and terrified, has shattered her door,
has dashed her window into air, has kicked her charcoal
to earth: and as he restores her to life with cold water and
warm kisses, he shows her a ticket for them both for to-night’s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bal Masqué</i>.</p>

<p>Clouds and sunrays, ye are Life! But beyond, beyond,
whirls and roars the dread Maelstrom of Inexplicability.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Promptings of the Ideal.</i></p>

<p>It was noon, Sir Edward had stepped from his
brougham and was proceeding on foot down the Strand.
He was dressed with his usual faultless taste, but in
alighting from his vehicle his foot had slipped, and a small
round disc of conglomerated soil, which instantly appeared
on his high arched instep, marred the harmonious glitter of
his boots. Sir Edward was fastidious. Casting his eyes
around, at a little distance he perceived the stand of a
youthful bootblack. Thither he sauntered, and carelessly
placing his foot on the low stool, he waited the application
of the polisher’s Art. “Tis true,” said Sir Edward to
himself, yet half aloud, “the contact of the Foul and the
Disgusting mars the general effect of the Shiny and the
Beautiful&mdash;and yet, why am I here? I repeat it, calmly
and deliberately&mdash;why am I here? Ha! Boy!”</p>

<p>The Boy looked up&mdash;his dark Italian eyes glanced
intelligently at the Philosopher, and, as with one hand he
tossed back his glossy curls from his marble brow, and
with the other he spread the equally glossy Day and Martin
over the Baronet’s boot, he answered in deep rich tones:
“The Ideal is subjective to the Real. The exercise of
apperception gives a distinctiveness to idiocracy, which is,
however, subject to the limits of <span class="sc">Me</span>. You are an admirer
of the Beautiful, sir. You wish your boots blacked. The
Beautiful is attainable by means of the Coin.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Sir Edward thoughtfully, gazing upon the
almost supernal beauty of the Child before him; “you
speak well. You have read <cite>Kant</cite>.”</p>

<p>The Boy blushed deeply. He drew a copy of <cite>Kant</cite> from
his bosom, but in his confusion several other volumes
dropped from his bosom on the ground. The Baronet
picked them up.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Philosopher, “what’s this? <cite>Cicero’s De
Senectute</cite>, and at your age, too? <cite>Martial’s Epigrams</cite>,
<cite>Cæsar’s Commentaries</cite>. What! a classical scholar?”</p>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“E pluribus Unum. Nux vomica. Nil desperandum.
Nihil fit!”</span> said the Boy, enthusiastically. The Philosopher
gazed at the Child. A strange presence seemed to transfuse
and possess him. Over the brow of the Boy glittered
the pale nimbus of the Student.</p>

<p>“Ah, and Schiller’s <cite>Robbers</cite> too?” queried the
Philosopher.</p>

<p><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Das ist ausgespielt,”</span> said the Boy modestly.</p>

<p>“Then you have read my translation of <cite>Schiller’s
Ballads</cite>?” continued the Baronet, with some show of
interest.</p>

<p>“I have, and infinitely prefer them to the original,” said
the Boy with intellectual warmth. “You have shown how
in Actual life we strive for a Goal we cannot reach; how in
the Ideal the Goal is attainable, and there effort is victory.
You have given us the Antithesis which is a key to the
Remainder, and constantly balances before us the conditions
of the Actual and the privileges of the Ideal.”</p>

<p>“My very words,” said the Baronet; “wonderful,
wonderful!” and he gazed fondly at the Italian boy, who
again resumed his menial employment. Alas! the wings
of the Ideal were folded. The Student had been absorbed
in the Boy.</p>

<p>But Sir Edward’s boots were blacked, and he turned to
depart. Placing his hand upon the clustering tendrils that
surrounded the classic nob of the infant Italian, he said
softly, like a strain of distant music:</p>

<p>“Boy, you have done well. Love the Good. Protect
the Innocent. Provide for The Indigent. Respect the
Philosopher.”... “Stay! Can you tell me what <em>is</em>
The True, The Beautiful, The Innocent, The Virtuous?”</p>

<p><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
“They are things that commence with a capital letter,”
said the Boy, promptly.</p>

<p>“Enough! Respect everything that commences with a
capital letter! Respect <span class="sc">Me</span>!” and dropping a halfpenny in
the hand of the Boy, he departed.</p>

<p>The Boy gazed fixedly at the coin. A frightful and
instantaneous change overspread his features. His noble
brow was corrugated with baser lines of calculation. His

<p><cite>On Conversation.</cite>&mdash;The basis of all conversation is Flat
Contradiction. The flatter and the stronger the contradiction,
the more certain and secure is the basis on which the
structure of Conversation is to rise.</p>

<p>Where there is no contradiction, “nothing more need be
said,” and consequently there and then is an end of all
conversation.</p>

<p>The word conversation in itself expresses and implies an
assertion of a fact and a denial. It is compounded of two
Latin words, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verso</i>” to turn, and “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">con</i>” together, and
means, therefore, two people turning together, or having
“a turn at one another,” or a “set-to.” Were everybody
to agree with everybody else, it is evident that there
would be no matter for discussion, and, therefore, no real
conversation.</p>

<p>Persons in love, who are, for the time being, in perfect
agreement with each other, never converse. They can’t.
It is from this universally-observed fact that in every language
may be found the significant proverb, “Silence gives
consent,” <i>i.e.</i>, where all agree there is, as we have said, no
conversation.</p>

<p><em>A knowledge of Human Nature is absolutely necessary for
the cultivation of good manners, and for getting oneself
generally liked in all sorts and varieties of Society.</em>&mdash;This is
an extensive subject, but its study will well repay the most
attentive <span class="lock">perusal:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Rules and Advice.</i>&mdash;In whatever society you may be, a
moderate share of penetration will enable you to find out
everybody’s weak points. You may not hit upon them all
at once, but make your own private list, and then try them
all round. Enter any room as though you were a general
practitioner called in to pronounce on everybody’s ailments.
You do not want to <em>see</em> their tongues, but only hear
how they use them. You can feel the pulse of each one
discreetly.</p>

<p><i>How to make yourself Agreeable with a Nouveau Riche.</i>&mdash;Be
playfully familiar. Lower yourself to <em>his</em> level; so as not
to appear proud of your superior birth and training.
Ascertain how he made his money, what was his origin;
and, if unable to discover what he sprang from, you can
make a safe guess in supposing him to have been a scavenger,
a dustman, or as boy engaged in sweeping out an office
(many illustrious men who have discharged the highest
offices, may have themselves been discharged from the
lowest offices for not having kept them clean and tidy), and
on this supposition you can at once address him, and
proceed to compare his former state of abject poverty with
his present apparently inexhaustible wealth, a subject that
must afford him the greatest possible pleasure, especially in
a mixed company.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">THOMAS DE QUINCEY.</p>

<p>His extraordinary work <cite>The Confessions of an English
Opium-Eater</cite> published in 1822, (having originally appeared
in the London Magazine), was the subject of an exceedingly
clever parody in <cite>Blackwood</cite> for December, 1856, attributed
to the pen of Sir E. G. Hamley.</p>

<p><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
“A Recent Confession of an Opium-Eater” tells how
the O.E., somewhere about the year 1828, found himself in
the sixteenth storey of a house in the old town of Edinburgh
in company with three most unprepossessing personages,
one of the feminine gender. He is at first disposed to
entertain a favourable opinion of the intellectual status of
his entertainers by the sympathising reception accorded to
some appreciative remarks offered by him on the greatness
of Burke, but afterwards sees reason to question whether
their Burke and his were the same person. By-and-by it
becomes apparent that his companions are intent upon
drugging him. The idea of anyone presuming to hocus the
opium-eater tickles his fancy immensely; he enters into the
joke, toasts his hosts in laudanum, and obliges them to
respond, and in due time has them all under the table. As
he goes down-stairs, a little misadventure occurs with a
candle, and by next morning the sixteen storeys and the
occupants have entirely disappeared. The style of the
parody is excellent, a compound of the Opium-Eater and
“Murder considered as one of the Fine Arts.”</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">COOKERY BOOKS.</p>

<p>During the Crimean War, when there was a
great outcry about the starving condition of
our troops, and the utter breakdown of the
Commissariat, the following parody on Mr. A.
Soyer’s cookery book appeared in “Our Miscellany,”
by Yates and <span class="lock">Brough:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Camp Cookery.</span></p>

<p class="center"><cite>By Alicksus Sawder</cite></p>

<p><i>To boil cabbage.</i>&mdash;It is necessary to procure a cabbage.
Wash in cold water; which, throw down a gutter, or
outside a tent if no gutter be procurable. Be careful not
to splash trousers, especially in frosty weather. Stick a
two-pronged fork boldly into the cabbage (a bayonet will
do equally well), and plunge it into a saucepan of water
just at boiling point. When it has boiled for eight
minutes, twenty-five seconds, throw eleven-fifteenths of a
teaspoonful of salt into the water. <em>Let the cabbage boil
till it is thoroughly done.</em> At that moment be on the
watch to take it out of the saucepan (taking care to avert
the face from the steam), and place in a vegetable dish.
Put the cover on, and serve up with roast beef, ortolans,
venison, pickled pork, or whatever may come handiest.
An old helmet will supply the place of a saucepan.
Cauliflowers may be cooked in the same manner; and,
indeed, most things.</p>

<p><i>To fry Bacon.</i>&mdash;Cut your bacon into long strips, or
rashers. Wipe your frying-pan out with a coarse towel,
or lining of old dressing-gown. Then place it gently (so
as not to knock the bottom out) over a brisk fire. Place
the rashers in, one by one. When they are done on one
side, turn them over to do on the other. When they
have attained a rich brown, take them out and arrange
them on a dish, or slice of bread, or anything. Watch
your rashers, so that the sentinel outside doesn’t get at
them; and eat when you feel inclined. The gravy may
be sopped up from the frying-pan with crumbs of bread.
If only biscuit is to be obtained, use the fingers, which
lick carefully. The rind may be preserved in the waistcoat
pocket, for sucking while on duty.</p>

<p><i>Roast Potatoes.</i>&mdash;Put your potatoes under the stove,
and rake hot embers over them. While they are cooking
get as much butter as the commissariat will allow you,
and put it on a clean dish, or, a dirty one, with half a
sheet of writing-paper on it (indeed, in an extreme case,
the writing-paper will enable you to dispense with the
dish altogether). Taste the butter, but don’t eat it all up
till the potatoes are done. Great care will be required
for the observance of the latter regulation. Cut the
butter into dice of from six to seven-eighths of a cubic
inch. When the potatoes are done, cut them open and
insert a dice of butter in each, closing the potato rapidly
to prevent evaporation. Eat with pepper and salt, or
whatever you can get.</p>

<p><i>Another Method.</i>&mdash;If you can’t get any butter, do without
it.</p>

<p><i>Potatoes and Point.</i>&mdash;This is a very popular dish in
Ireland, and one which I have frequently partaken of in
that country. The method of preparing it in the Crimea
is as follows:&mdash;Boil a dish of potatoes, and serve up hot,
with a watch-glass full of powdered salt. When they are
ready for eating, point, with the fore-finger of the right
hand, in a north-westerly direction, where the regions of
beef are supposed to exist.</p>

of Cookery</cite>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Military Cookery-Book.</span></p>

<p><i>How to make a Recruit.</i>&mdash;Take a raw lad from the country
(the younger the better) and fill his head with military froth.
Add a shilling and as much beer as will be covered by the
bounty-money. Let him simmer, and serve him up thick
before a Magistrate the next morning. Let him be sworn
in, and he then will be nicely done.</p>

<p><i>How to make a Soldier.</i>&mdash;Take your recruit, and thrust
him roughly into a depôt. Mix him up well with recruits
from other regiments until he has lost any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
which may have been floating upon the surface when he
enlisted. Now let him lie idle for a few years until his
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
strength is exhausted, and then, at ten minutes’ notice, pack
him off to India.</p>

<p><i>Another Method.</i>&mdash;Take your recruit, and place him at
headquarters. Let him mix freely with all the bad characters
that have been carefully kept in the regiment, until his
nature has become assimilated to theirs. For three years
pay him rather less than a ploughboy’s wages, and make
him work rather harder than a costermonger’s donkey.
Your soldier having now reached perfection, you will turn
him out of the Service with Economical Dressing.</p>

<p><i>How to make a Deserter.</i>&mdash;A very simple and popular dish.
Take a soldier, see that he is perfectly free from any mark
by which he may be identified, and fill his head with
grievances. Now add a little opportunity, and you have,
or, rather, you have not, your deserter.</p>

<p><i>Another and Simpler Method.</i>&mdash;Take a recruit, without
inquiring into his antecedents. Give him his kit and bounty-money
and close your eyes. The same recruit may be used
for this dish (which will be found to be a fine military hash)
any number of times.</p>

<p><i>How to make an Army.</i>&mdash;Take a few scores of Infantry
Regiments and carefully proceed to under-man them. Add
some troopers without horses, and some batteries without
guns. Throw in a number of unattached Generals, and
serve up the whole with a plentiful supply of Control
Mixture.</p>

<p><i>Another and Easier Method.</i>&mdash;Get a little ink, a pen, and
a sheet of paper. Now dip your pen in the ink, and with
it trace figures upon your sheet of paper. The accompaniment
to this dish is usually hot water.</p>

<p><i>How to make a Panic.</i>&mdash;Take one or two influential newspapers
in the dead season of the year, and fill them with
smartly written letters. Add a few pointed leading articles,
and pull your Army into pieces. Let the whole simmer
until the opening of Parliament. This once popular mess is
now found to be rather insipid, unless it is produced nicely
garnished with plenty of Continental sauce, mixed with just
an idea of Invasion relish. With these zests, however, it
is always found to be toothsome, although extremely expensive.</p>

<p>“I made a pilgrimage to Holloway Castle one day last
week, and was pleased to find poor Edmund in excellent
spirits. He was lounging in a handsomely upholstered
chair from Gillow’s, while he smoked a capital Manilla.<cite>From “Truth.”</cite>
In the course of our conversation, I learnt that it is his
intention to publish a volume of ‘Prison Recollections’
when he again emerges into the outer world. Edmund
has lost flesh, but is otherwise in his usual health.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Extract <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></span> (<cite>From “The World.”</cite>)</p>

<p>“Really, Henry, I am getting quite tired of correcting
your blunders. The chair in which you found me
seated was supplied to me by Maple, whom I much
prefer to Gillow. You have also put your foot in it about
the cigar, which was an Intimidad and not a Manilla.
Thirdly, I <em>don’t</em> intend to publish any ‘Prison Recollections;’
and as for my having lost flesh, that is pure
rubbish. How <em>can</em> one lose flesh when one continues to
feed as well as usual, and is at the same time obliged to
drop one’s horse exercise in the Row?”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Extract <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></span> (<cite>From “Truth.”</cite>)</p>

<p>“I have always maintained that you are far too
impetuous, Edmund. Perhaps you are correct about
your not having lost flesh, though I could have sworn
that I counted one chin less than usual upon your face.
I may also have been in error regarding the ‘Recollections’
and the chair, but I cannot for a moment admit
that your Manilla was an Intimidad. You are no judge
of tobacco. I am, and the illustrated advertisement of
Somebody’s cigarettes is sufficient proof of the fact.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy.</span></p>

<p>A short parody, having the above title appeared in <cite>Punch</cite>,
May 19, 1888, with an illustration by Linley Sambourne,
representing Lord Randolph Churchill, and the Duke of
Cambridge. At the time it appeared Lord Randolph was
posing as an advocate of Retrenchment and Reform. That
a member of the Marlborough family of national bloodsuckers
should appear as the advocate of economy was a joke that
was far too good to last, and Lord Randolph having remained
in the cabinet long enough to earn a pension, found it convenient
to resign.</p>

<p class="center">(<cite>An imaginary conversation. With apologies to Mrs.
F. H. Burnett.</cite>)</p>

<p>And then the Duke looked up.</p>

<p>What Little Grandolph saw was a portly old man, with
scanty white hair and bushy whiskers, and a nose like a
florid bulb between his prominent imperious eyes.</p>

<p>What the Duke saw was a smart, small figure in a jaunt,
suit, with a large collar, and with trim, accurately-parted
locks curved carefully about the curiously canine little face
whose equally protuberant eyes met his with a look of&mdash;well,
perhaps the Duke would have found it difficult exactly
to define the character of that look, but it combined in an
emphatic way the interrogative and the ironical.</p>

<p>It was thought that Little Lord Fauntleroy was himself
rather like a small copy of a grander and older original, and
he himself was supposed to be well aware of the fact. But
there was a sudden glow of emotion in the irascible old
Duke’s face as he saw what a sturdy, self-confident little
fellow Lord Fauntleroy was, and how unhesitatingly he stood
to his guns in all circumstances. It moved the grim old
nobleman that the youngster should show no shyness or fear,
either of the situation or of himself.</p>

<p>“Are you the Duke?” he said. “I’m a Duke’s son, you
see, and know something about such things. I’m Lord
Grandolph Fauntleroy.”</p>

<p>He nodded affably, because he knew it to be the polite
and proper thing to do, even from young and clever Lords
to old and (the adjective he mentally used may be suppressed)
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
Dukes. “I hope you&mdash;and the Army&mdash;are all right,” he
continued, with the utmost airiness. “I’m very glad to see
you here.”</p>

<p>“Glad to see me, are you?” said the Duke.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Lord Fauntleroy, “very.”</p>

<p>There was a chair at the head of the table, and he sat
down on it; it was a big chair, and, physically, he hardly
filled it perhaps; but he seemed quite at his ease as he sat
there, and regarded a Monarch’s august relative intently and
confidently.</p>

<p>“I’ve often wondered what a Commander-in-Chief would
look like when being cross-examined,” he remarked. “I’ve
wondered whether he’d be anything like my great ancestor
of the Queen Anne epoch.”</p>

<p>“Am I?” asked the Duke.</p>

<p>“Well,” Grandolph replied, “I’ve only seen pictures
of him, of course, and I can’t exactly say how he would
have looked in a similar case, but I don’t <em>think</em> you are
much like him.”</p>

<p>“You are disappointed, I suppose?” suggested his
august interlocutor.</p>

<p>“Oh no!” replied Grandolph, politely. “Of course
you would like any great military contemporary to look
like your own illustrious ancestor; but of course you
<em>might</em> admire the way your great military contemporary
looked, even if he wasn’t like your illustrious ancestor.
You know how it is yourself, about admiring your contemporaries.”</p>

<p>The Duke stared. He could hardly be said to know
how it was about admiring his contemporaries, many of
whom he didn’t admire at all, and some of whom did not
altogether admire him.</p>

<p>“Well, and how’s our bit of an Army getting on?”
asked little Lord Fauntleroy, airily.</p>

<p>“Our&mdash;bit&mdash;of&mdash;an&mdash;Army?” repeated the Duke, in a
scattered sort of way.</p>

<p>“Yes,” explained Grandolph, “the bit of an Army we
pay such a pile of money for?”</p>

<p>“Ha!” ejaculated his Lordship. “That’s it, is it?
The money isn’t spent as you like. You’d like to have the
spending of it. What would <em>you</em> buy with it? I should
like to hear something about that.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” replied Lord Fauntleroy, coolly. “Some
day you may. At present <em>I’m</em> asking questions, and your
business is to answer them.”</p>

<p>“The D&mdash;&mdash;!” began the Duke, hotly.</p>

<p>“Quite so&mdash;the D&mdash;&mdash; etails,” interjected Little Lord
Fauntleroy, blandly. “As you were doubtless about to
say, the details are the things! All very well to say in a
general sort of way that the Army is going to&mdash;its usual
destination, Duke; that Party Spirit and Financial
Cheese-paring are the cause of it, and that more men and
money are urgently required. That won’t do for me. I
want to know&mdash;so does the Country&mdash;much more than
that. How? Why? What? When? How many?
How much? These, my dear Duke, are the pertinent
questions to which we&mdash;the Country and I&mdash;demand precise
answers. When we get them, instead of vague
denunciation and big D’s, we shall know what to do.”</p>

<p>The sensations of his Royal Highness the Duke, could
scarcely be described. He was not an old nobleman who
was very easily taken aback, because he had seen a great
deal of the official world; but here was something he
found so novel that it almost took his lordly breath away,
and caused him some singular emotions. A civilian had
always seemed to him a most objectionable creature&mdash;impertinent,
parsimonious, and with inadequate conceptions
of discipline. But this composed, precise, insolently
interrogative little personage was a portent. The Duke’s

<p><cite>The Standard</cite> (London) in 1885 ventured to
criticise the political character and conduct of
Lord Randolph Churchill, but three years
later it contained an article which read like
a parody of its former utterances about this
Boulanger of the Fourth <span class="lock">Party:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">(From the <cite>Standard</cite>, <br />
July 31, 1885.)</p>

<p>It is time to speak plainly.
Lord Randolph Churchill
has been puffed by his
friends in the daily and
weekly press with admirable
assiduity. He has
dined with them and they
have dined with him, and
the well-organised <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">claque</i>
are ready to cry “Prodigious!”
whenever he opens
his mouth. But it is all in
vain. We no longer live in
days when the public can
be gulled by such arts.…
The truth is, that
Lord Randolph Churchill is
a much over-rated man.
He is now verging upon
middle-age and has reached
a time of life when even
flighty minds ought to sober
down. But this is what he
cannot do. His almost incredible
ignorance of affairs,
his boyish delight in offering
the crudest insults to men
who have been fifty years
in the service of the State,
his pranks, his blunders,
are ceasing to amuse.…
Instead of his being broken
in by his colleagues, his
colleagues have been broken
in by him, and he has been
able to make them adopt
as the deliberate and well-digested
convictions of sagacious
and practical Englishmen,
the crude conceits
of a political neophyte,
which his own little Senate
labour hard to represent
as the language of a new
Tory gospel.…
We will follow Lord Salisbury,
but we will not be
governed by a sort of
overgrown schoolboy, who
thinks he is witty when he
is only impudent, and who
really does not seem to possess
sufficient knowledge
even to fathom the depths
of his own ignorance of
everything worthy of the
name of statesmanship.</p>

<p class="center">(From the <cite>Standard</cite>, <br />
July 29, 1888.)</p>

<p>The interest excited by
the other appointments
sinks into nothing compared
with that which
must be felt in the promotion
of Lord R. Churchill
to the Chancellorship of
the Exchequer and the
leadership of the House of
Commons. There is, doubtless,
much that may be said
against the appointment to
so responsible a position of
one who has had so brief
an experience of official
life, and who has hitherto
been more remarkable for
brilliancy than discretion.
On the other hand, Lord
Randolph Churchill possesses
the debating power
and the dauntless spirit
which are indispensable to
a successful leader. There
are times and seasons when
self-confidence, readiness,
and a command of that
pungent rhetoric which
often tells better in the
House of Commons than
the closest and most
judicial argument, are of
more service to a party
than any other qualities
which a Parliamentary
statesman can possess.
Lord Randolph Churchill
moreover, is eminently
popular with “the masses,”
and so far has a title to
confront Mr. Gladstone
which no other man on the
Conservative side of the
House can show. In
short, he is an orator and
a wit; and in a popular
assembly these are titles to
pre-eminence which it is
not very easy to dispute.
It remains for Lord Randolph
Churchill to demonstrate
that the great confidence
that has been reposed
in him has not been misplaced.</p>

<p>Taken in connection with the above extracts,
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
it is amusing to read the leader which appeared
in <cite>The Standard</cite>, July 31, 1889:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord Randolph Churchill used his opportunities at Birmingham
yesterday to illustrate, on a more ambitious scale
than he has yet attempted, his constitutional incapacity for
public life. A Statesman should be discreet; and even the
hack politician is expected to be loyal to his associates.
Lord Randolph has been at some pains to prove that no
colleagues can trust him, and that no school of opinion can
rely upon him for six weeks together. He made several
speeches yesterday, and discussed at considerable length,
and with an air of dogmatic assurance, a variety of topics.
But the miscellaneous heads were all firmly held together
by one pervading principle. Lord Randolph Churchill, his
position and prospects, and the supreme importance of improving
both at any cost, constituted the informing element
of the whole medley. It does not, of course, follow that
because Lord Randolph played a selfish game, he played a
wise one. His addresses, we imagine, will strike him as
poor reading by daylight. Even in the atmosphere of the
City Hall, the reception was not altogether encouraging. It is
not flattering to an orator to find that sayings which he meant
to be oracular provoked merriment; that his serious things
were taken as jokes and his jokes as serious things; and
that solemn declarations of policy, which were designed to
draw ringing cheers, were listened to in chilling silence, or,
still worse, excited immediate and emphatic protest.</p>

<p>This was a burlesque of “Lady Audley’s Secret” which
appeared in <cite>Judy</cite>, 1868. It was written by Mr. Walter
Parke. The following is an extract from this humorous
<span class="lock">work:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Chapter xii.</span></p>

<p>Day had broken (though <span class="sc">Martin</span> was still solvent) and
was casting brilliant Holborn Bars of light through the
windows of Tredethlyn Abbey on to the artistic Phiz of
Lady Aurorabella.</p>

<p>She was very very weary&mdash;tired of her own life, and of
several other people’s lives, also she had not the heart to
eat, and probably would not have eaten it if she had.
Beyond trifling with the wing of a rabbit, cutting a morsel
from a cold surloin of grouse, and drinking a single glass of
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Chiaroscuro</i>, her breakfast was untouched.</p>

<p>For she had just received intelligence that, in spite of all
her exertions, her <span class="sc">Five Husbands</span> were again at liberty!</p>

<p>“Oh! why did they not all perish?” she sobbed. “I
have tried to get rid of them over and over again by every
species of assassination, but now I am tired of <em>mild</em>
measures. I must do something <span class="sc">Desperate</span>!”</p>

<p>So she summoned that ubiquitous detective officer,
Inspector Weasel, who, from any quarter of the globe,
would come by telegraph to obey her slightest word.</p>

<p>“Weasel” she said “I can endure this no longer, I
have made a resolve. By the tyrannical laws of this
hateful country, my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quintette</i> of husbands have been
allowed to keep the marriage certificates. Once in
possession of <em>them</em>, I could defy the world. If you value
my peace or your own, you must get them for me.”</p>

<p>“I will,” replied the all accomplished detective and he
set about it at once.</p>

<p>First, to pursue the fugitive Dr. Marchmont, “Ah”
murmured the Detective “my experience tells me that when
a fellow on the bolt says he is going to one place, he is
certain to set off in exactly the opposite direction. Let me
see,” And he carefully examined his Government survey
of the World.</p>

<p class="center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

<p>Inspector Weasel hastened to the Snoozington Railway
Station.</p>

<p>“What time does the next train start for Kamtschatka?”
“At 6.85,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The detective chafed with impatience. Two minutes to
wait! It seemed an eternity-and-a-half to him! At length
the train arrived and the detective jumped up behind the
Engine Driver. “Off we go!” he cried, “bother stations,
and signals, and all that sort of thing, never mind bursting
the engine, or blowing up the passengers. I’m in a
hurry!”</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">THE POLITE LETTER WRITER.</p>

<p>At the distribution of prizes to the art classes
at Chesterfield in November, 1880, the secretary
read a communication purporting to come
from Mr. John Ruskin, in answer to one asking
him to give them a lecture. It was as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="quotesig small">“Harlesden, London, Friday.&emsp;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“My dear Sir,&mdash;Your letter reaches me here. I have
just returned from Venice, where I have ruminated in the
pasturages of the home of art; the loveliest and holiest of
lovely and holy cities, where the very stones cry out,
eloquent in the elegancies of Iambics. I could not if I
would go to Chesterfield, and I much doubt whether I
would go if I could. I do not hire myself out&mdash;after the
fashion of a brainless long tongued puppet&mdash;for filthy
ducats. You, and those who told you to write me, want
me, I presume, to come that you may make money for
your art class; and if I should get you much money, you
will then tolerate some good advice from me. No, I will
not come.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I have heard of Chesterfield. Hath it not a steeple-abomination,
and is it not the home&mdash;if not the cradle&mdash;of
that arch abomination-creator, Stephenson? To him
are we indebted for the screeching and howling and
shrieking fiends fit only for a Pandemonium, called locomotives,
that disfigure the loveliest spots of God’s own
land.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I will not come to Chesterfield. Tell your students
that art is a holy luxury, and they must pay for it. Tell
them to study, to ponder, and to work with a single thought
for perfection, observing loving and strict obedience to the
monitions of their teacher. Let them learn to do things
rightly and humbly, and then, by the conviction that they
can never do them as well as they have been done by
others, they may be profited.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“My good young people, this is pre-eminently the foolishest&mdash;yes,
quite the foolishest&mdash;notion that you can get
into your empty little egg-shells of heads; that you can be
a Titian, or a Raphael, or a Phidias; or that you can
write like Seneca. But because you cannot be great, that
is no reason why you should not aspire to greatness. In
joy, humility, and humbleness, work together. Only don’t
study art because it will pay, and do not ask for payment
because you study art. Art will make you all wiser and
happier, and is worth paying for. If you are in debt&mdash;as
I suppose you are, or why pester me?&mdash;pay off your debts
yourselves. If you write to me only that you may get
money, you are on the foolishest of all errands. Wisdom
is more precious than rubies, and is offered to you as a
blessing in herself. She is the reward of industry, kindness
and modesty. She is the prize of prizes, the strength
of your life now, and an earnest of the life that is to come.
This advice is better than money, and I give it to you
gratis. Ponder it and profit by it.&mdash;Ever faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="quotesig small"><span class="sc">John Ruskin.</span>”&emsp;</p>

<p>Many were the comments which this letter,
widely published, as it was, created; for scarcely
any one doubted the authenticity of the letter
addressed to Chesterfield, a name which recals
that of a celebrated Earl who also wrote letters,
but <em>his</em> were on the art of politeness.</p>

<p>But a few days afterwards Mr. Ruskin denied
that he had composed the epistle; it is, therefore,
only of interest now as so clever a parody
of his style that the whole London press was
deceived by it. The following letter, however,
was certainly genuine. In June 1886, a circular
was addressed to Mr. Ruskin appealing for subscriptions
towards extinquishing the debt of
the Baptist Church at Richmond, to which
he <span class="lock">replied:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am sorrowfully amused at your appeal to me, of
all people in the world the precisely least likely to give you
a farthing. My first word to all men and boys who care to
hear me is “Don’t get into debt. Starve, and go to
heaven; but don’t borrow. Try first begging. I don’t
mind, if it’s really needful, stealing. But don’t buy things
you can’t pay for.” And of all manner of debtors, pious
people building churches they can’t pay for are the most
detestable nonsense to me. Can’t you preach and pray
behind the hedges, or in a sandpit, or in a coal-hole first?
And of all manner of churches thus idiotically built, iron
churches are the damnablest to me. And of all the sects
and believers in any ruling spirit, Hindoos, Turks, Feather
Idolators, and Mumbo Jumbo Log and Fire Worshippers,
who want churches, your modern English Evangelical sect
is the most absurd and entirely objectionable and unendurable
to me. All which you might very easily have found
out from my books. Any other sort of sect would, before
bothering me to write it to them.&mdash;Ever, nevertheless, and
in all this saying, your faithful servant,</p>

<p class="small">Horace Smith, one of the authors of <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>,
wrote a number of historical novels, most of which are now
entirely forgotten. One of these was called <cite>Brambletye
House</cite>, to ridicule which Dr. William Maginn wrote
<cite>Whitehall</cite>.</p>

<p class="small">“The author’s object,” said the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, in January
1828, “is to laugh down the Brambletye House species of
novel; and for this purpose we are presented with such an
historical romance as an author of Brambletye House,
flourishing in Barbadoes 200 or 2,000 years hence, we are
not certain which, nor is the circumstance of material
moment, might fairly be expected to compose of and concerning
the personages, manners, and events of the age and
country in which we live * * * * The book is,
in fact, a series of parodies upon unfortunate Mr. Horace
Smith,&mdash;and it is paying the author no compliment to say
that his mimicry (with all its imperfections) deserves to outlive
the ponderous original.”</p>

Another, but very inferior version, was brought out at
the Opera Comique, London, by Mr. Bandmann about

however, soon compelled Mr. Bandmann to withdraw his

<p class="center ls">COMPANY PROSPECTUSES.</p>

<p>Of late years the British public has been
surfeited with the Prospectuses of new Limited
Liability Companies; needy Lords and retired
officers have been in great request for the
Boards of Directors, they being precisely the
two classes of men least likely to have any
knowledge of business, or experience in commercial
affairs.</p>

<p>Some of these Prospectuses have been so ridiculous in
themselves that they read like burlesques, but numbers of
amusing parodies of Company Prospectuses have also
been published.</p>

<p>One of the best and earliest of these appeared in <cite>Blackwood’s
Magazine</cite>, October 1845 during the great Railway
Mania. It was written by Professor Aytoun, and was
styled “How we got up the Glenmutchin Railway, and
how we got out of it.”</p>

<p>This detailed the inception of a bogus Scotch Railway,
and the prospectus of the <cite>Direct Glenmutchin Railway</cite>,
with a list of the Directors, is one of the finest pieces of
humorous writing in the language.</p>

<p>Another amusing parody was brought out some years
ago, namely “The Gott-up Hotel Company, Limited,”
with Sir Titus A. Drum, Baronet, as Chairman of the
Directors.</p>

<p>When the Crown Prince of Portugal visited London in
1883, he went to Claridge’s Hotel, as he had not been
invited to any of the Royal Palaces, this caused <cite>Mr. Punch</cite>
to issue the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">PROMISING PROSPECTUS.</p>

<p class="center sc">The Royal and Imperial Homeless and Wandering
Visitors Hotel Company (Limited).</p>

<p>The Directors of this unique and magnificently conceived
enterprise, undertaken with a view to supplying that now
long experienced National want, a suitable palatial
residence for Princes and Potentates found wandering in
search of a fitting domicile about the back streets of the
Metropolis, have much pleasure in informing their intended
august Patrons, that their perfectly-appointed establishment
will shortly open under the direction of a well-known and
experienced retired Central-European Monarch, whose
distinguished services they have had the honour to secure.</p>

<p>The following (extracted from the Company’s Abridged
Prospectus) comprise a few of the leading features of the
new <span class="lock">establishment:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hanging">The building will stand on a convenient and imposing site
judiciously selected in the immediate vicinity of the
Metropolitan District Railway Station, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s
Park, and within easy access of the Aquarium,
Westminster Bridge, the House of Detention, and the
Foreign Office.</p>

<p class="hanging">There will be no lettered name or title on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">façade</i> of the
new Hotel, which will, with the object of giving rise
to a pleasing illusion, be specially designed by the
architect to resemble as far as possible that of a not far
distant and generally unoccupied Royal Palace.</p>

<p class="hanging">A trained and certificated Diplomatist, who can speak several
European languages fluently, will be permanently
attached to the staff of the establishment, and will give
his services gratis.</p>

<p class="hanging">A couple of effective Sentry Boxes will also be placed at the
principal entrance, and occupied permanently by two of
the Company’s Private Soldiers, who, dressed in the
correct uniform of <span class="sc">Her Majesty’s</span> Foot Guards, will
be efficiently drilled for their duty.</p>

<p class="hanging">Gold Sticks in Waiting will attend in the Hall for the
purpose of receiving Royal and Imperial Visitors.
They will also, if desired to do so, precede them to
their respective apartments, walking backwards
up-stairs for a small extra charge.</p>

<p class="hanging">The general scheme of the establishment will include
several public Throne and Reading Rooms, A Privy
Council Chamber, Gala Banquet Hall, and a series of
excellent Billiard and Abdication Tables by the best
makers.</p>

<p>In order to meet the requirements of august personages
who desire to be surrounded at a reasonable cost with such
State accessories as are proper to their dignity and position,
the subjoined Tariff of Prices has been carefully arranged
by the Management, in the hope that it will be found not
incompatible with a charge on the most moderate civil
<span class="lock">list:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Prospectus of the Horse Shoe Hotel</span>,</p>
<p class="center">Tottenham Court Road, London.</p>

<p>This hotel was built and arranged for the special comfort
and convenience of the travelling public.</p>

<p>On arrival, each guest will be asked how he likes the
situation, and if he says the hotel ought to have been placed
nearer the park or railway station, the location of the house
will be immediately changed. Front rooms, on first floor,
for each guest.</p>

escape, restaurant, bar-room, billiard tables, daily papers,
sewing machine, grand piano, a clergyman, and all other
modern conveniences in every room.</p>

<p>Meals every minute if desired. Waiters of any
desired nationality.</p>

<p>Every waiter furnished with a libretto, button-hole bouquets,
full dress suits, theatre tickets, the latest tips, and
his hair parted down the middle. Every guest will have
the best seat in the dining hall, and the best waiter in the
house.</p>

<p>Any guest not getting his breakfast red hot, or experiencing
a delay of fifteen seconds after giving his order for
dinner, will please mention the fact at the Manager’s Office,
and the cooks and waiters will at once be blown by Her
Majesty’s Horse Guards from the mouth of the cannon.</p>

<p>Children will be welcomed with delight, and are requested
to bring hoop-sticks and jack-knives, to bang and hack the
carved rosewood furniture, specially provided for the
purpose; they will be allowed to thump the piano at all
hours, fall down stairs, scream and yell to their heart’s
content, carry away dessert enough for a small family in
their pockets at dinner, and make themselves otherwise as
agreeable and entertaining as the fondest mother can desire.
Washing underlinen allowed in all the drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>A discreet waiter, who belongs to the Masons, Odd
Fellows, and Women’s Suffrage, and who was never known
to tell the truth, has been employed to carry milk punches
and hot toddies to the ladies’ rooms in the evening.</p>

<p>The office clerk has been carefully selected to please
everybody, and can play unlimited loo, match worsteds at
the shop round the corner, toss for drinks at any hour, day
or night, play billiards, a good waltzer, amuse the children,
is a good judge of horses, as a railroad reference is far
superior to the A B C, Bradshaw’s, or anybody else’s guide,
will flirt with any young lady, and not mind being cut dead
when “Pa comes down,” don’t mind being damned any
more than the Regent’s Canal, can put forty people into the
best room in the house when the hotel is full, and answer
questions in Greek, Hebrew, Choctaw, Irish, or any other
polite language, at the same moment, without turning a
hair.</p>

<p>Dogs allowed in any room in the house, including the
w(h)ine room. Gentlemen can drink, smoke, swear, chew,
gamble, tell shady stories, stare at the new arrivals, or
indulge in any other innocent amusements in any part of
the hotel.</p>

<p>The landlord will always be happy to hear that some
other hotel is “the best in the country,” and that his is the
very worst.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Quill Toothpick Attachment Company, Limited</span>,</p>

<p class="unindent">has been formed to supply the whole world with Quill
Toothpicks, the interiors of which will be charged with
hydraulically compressed drinks, such as the stout of Guinness,
the ale of Bass, the champagne of <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span>,
the whiskey of <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span>, the port of <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span>,
and the sherry of <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span>.</p>

<p><em>Might charge these as advertisements, say £25 each, and
cheap enough at the money.</em></p>

<p>By means of a new forcing machine, which the vendor is
now trying to invent, he thinks that a quart of Guinness or
a bottle of Champagne can be readily compressed into the
interior of a Toothpick, and when in the mouth the contents
will be gently and gradually released by the touch of a spring.
The Tea of <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span>, and the Coffee of <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span>
will be stored in a similar manner. The Company will grant
Royalties to Temperance Societies.</p>

chap&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;for advertisement. If you can, get
some soft soap into the prospectus, Pears’ should be safe for
at least £100.</em></p>

<p>The advantages of the Quill Toothpick Attachment must
be apparent to the meanest capacity. For instance, a man
is invited out to dine, and finds himself in danger of being
poisoned. He pulls out a Toothpick charged with the desired
drink, and the morning headache is avoided. Ten thousand

the female leaders of society, and it is anticipated that the
use of toothpicks will soon become common to both sexes at
every meal. As a further development it is anticipated
that hosts will soon cease altogether to provide bottled drinks
for their guests, and in place thereof will lay in quantities of
Toothpicks charged by the Company. The contents of the
Toothpicks will in all cases be absolutely guaranteed to be
what they are, and this the Directors distinctly guarantee it

<p>The prospects of the Company are exceedingly brilliant.

“is in round figures <span class="lock">&emsp;&emsp;,000,000,000,”</span> and the Professor

<p><em>Fill in at discretion</em>.</p>

<p>The Company hope to make very large profits out of the

negotiations for the purchase of farms and ranches in the

cultivation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anser Vulgaris</i>, or common goose.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anser Vulgaris</i> flourishes everywhere, and by
gentle persuasion readily and painlessly parts with its
feathers, in fact it generally takes some time to discover
that anything is wrong. The gander parts less readily,
and as a rule the feathers are small and so few in number
as to be hardly worth plucking.</p>

<p>There is another well-known and exceedingly strong
feathered breed of goose (<i>Anser Stockexchangeiensis</i>)
frequenting the numerous runs adjacent Capel Court. This
breed parts with no persuasion, in fact at times it courts
being plucked, but it has a nasty habit of shortly wanting
back again all its own feathers and as many of other
people’s as it can possibly grab hold of. Sometimes, but
not often, it loses nearly every feather it has got, and then
it gently hisses, and horribly blasphemes.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">On Farming.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<cite>Lecture Written by Mark Twain when a Boy.</cite>)</p>

<p>Farming is healthy work; but no man can run a farm
and wear his best clothes at the same time. Either the
farming must cease while the new clothes continues, or the
new clothes must cease while farming continues. This
shows that farming is not so clean work as being a Congressman
or schoolmaster, for these men can wear good
clothes if they can find money to pay for them. Farmers
get up early in the morning. They say the early bird
catches the worm. If I was a bird, I had rather get up
late and eat cherries in place of worms. Farmers don’t
paint their waggons when they can help it, for they show
mud too quick. The colour of their boots is red, and don’t
look like other people’s boots, because they are twice as
big. Farmers’ wives have a hard time cooking for hired
men, and the hired men find fault with the farmers’ wives’
cooking. Why don’t farmers’ wives let the hired men do
the cooking while they do the finding fault? Farmers
don’t get as rich as bank presidents, but they get more
exercise. Some ask&mdash;“Why don’t farmers run for
Congress?” They run so much keeping boys out of their
peach orchards and melon patches they don’t have any time
to run after anything else. If Congress should run after
farmers, one might be caught now and then. Lawyers
can beat farmers at running for most anything. I know a
farmer who tried to run a line fence according to his notion.
The other man objected and hurt the farmer. The farmer
hired a lawyer to run his line fence, and now the lawyer
runs the farmer’s farm, and the farmer has stopped
running anything.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Regulations in the United States Navy.</span></p>

<p>A Buffalo paper prints the following extracts from a
manuscript treatise on naval discipline, prepared by the
Secretary of the American Navy:&mdash;“The custom of
sailing before the wind should be avoided, whenever it is
possible, as experience has demonstrated that it is much
better to wait for the breeze and carry it along, if not
too heavy. Commanders of sailing ships-of-war, I have
observed, are addicted to the practice of ‘staggering
under all they can carry.’ This matter will receive early
attention, as the necessity for reform in this direction
would seem imperative. When dirty weather is threatened,
or when there is reason to suspect breakers ahead, the
captain should heave to, or three, but never more than
four. In taking on board ammunition, and powder, and
shot, and shells and caps, &amp;c., the fore, main, and mizen
trucks should be utilised, in connection with the animals
belonging to the horse marines. It is deemed best to
abolish dog-watches. The practice is believed to encourage
idleness among the sailors, and necessitates the keeping
on board a number of useless beasts whose presence must
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
be anything but desirable. In the interests of economy,
the allowance for captains’ gigs should be withdrawn.
It is plain that they are of no real utility on ship-board,
and that they are at all times in the way. When on
shore the captains can avail themselves of the street
railway, or of the facilities afforded by the livery stables.
All anchors should be accurately weighed before being
taken on board, and the weight plainly marked on each,
thereby saving time and trouble when a ship is about to
take her departure. All ‘splicing’ should be done by the
chaplain, as he is the person upon whom the performance
of the ceremony most properly devolves. When sailing
in tropical seas, the breeches of the guns should be removed
and carefully stowed away, to be replaced when again
entering colder latitudes and longitudes. The practice of
carrying logs, merely for the purpose of ‘heaving’ them
is of questionable propriety, and will form a subject for
future enquiry.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">SLANG, CANT, AND FLASH.</h3>

<p>As Slang is a species of parody of our
mother tongue, and as many songs are written
in it, it must be alluded to in this Collection,
however briefly.</p>

<p>A few examples will be quoted, followed
by a bibliography, including mention also of
Dictionaries devoted to Satirical and Political
slang.</p>

<p>Thieves slang, or “cant,” is of multifold origin, but
is mainly derived from Romany or gipsy talk, with an
admixture of Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and French words.</p>

<p>Rhyming and back-slang are two other forms of purely
native manufacture, both arbitrary, and artificial in
their construction.</p>

<p>By the former any word that rhymes with the one
that is intended is substituted for it, and gradually becomes
accepted. This method is somewhat complicated, and
is, of course, almost unintelligible to the uninitiated, which
is precisely why it is adopted by thieves and their associates.</p>

<p>Back-slang is largely patronised by costermongers. It
consists in spelling backwards the principal words in a
sentence, with more or less accuracy. Thus, “Hi, yob!
kool that enif elrig with the nael ekom. Ssap her a
top o’ reeb and a tib of occabot,” simply means
“Hi boy! look at that fine girl with the lean moke.
Pass her a pot of beer and a bit of tobacco.”</p>

<p>Although slang is principally indulged in by the lower
orders and criminal classes, it must not be forgotten that
many slang words have been adopted and incorporated into
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
our general language, to say nothing of Americanisms,
which are also constantly being absorbed. Every profession,
too, has its slang, or technical language, which is
mainly unintelligible to the outside world. Thus Soldiers,
Sailors, Engineers, Doctors, and Lawyers, have their own
phraseology, but what is most objectionable is the Clerical
slang. This imparts a fine full flavoured tone of hypocrisy to
any ordinary conversation by dragging in “D.V.”
references to the Deity, and the quotation of scraps of Holy
writ in the most unnecessary profusion, and in the most
unseemly contrast with trivial statements of every day
life.</p>

<p>I buzzed a bloak and a shakester of a reader and a skin.
My jomer stalled. A cross cove, who had his regulars,
called out “cop bung,” so as a pig was marking, I speeled
to the crib, where I found Jim had been pulling down
sawney for grub. He cracked a case last night and fenced
the swag. He told me as Bill had flimped a yack and
pinched a swell of a fawney, he sent the yack to church and
got three finnups and a cooter for the fawney.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Translation.</span></p>

<p>I picked the pockets of a gentleman and lady of a pocket
book and a purse. My fancy girl screened me from observation.
A fellow thief, who shared my plunder, called out
to me to hand over the stolen property, so as someone was
observing my actions, I ran off to the house, where Jim had
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">276</span>
some bacon he had stolen from a shop door. He broke into
a house last night, and had sold the stolen property. He
told me that Bill had hustled a man and stolen his watch,
and had also robbed a gentleman of a ring. He had sent
the watch to have its works removed, and had got three
five pound notes and a sovereign for the ring.</p>

<div class="i3">And moisten his gob ’fore he died.</div>

<div class="i1">“Hould your tongue in that matter,” says he;</div>
<div class="i2">“For the neckcloth I don’t care a button,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The boys they came crowding in fast;</div>

<div class="i1">Six glims<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_277" id="fnanchor_277"></a><a href="#footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></span> round his coffin they placed&mdash;</div>

<div class="i1">Then the cards being call’d for, they play’d,</div>

<div class="i1">So mournful these last words he spoke,</div>

<div class="i1">For my part, I thought my heart broke</div>
<div class="i2">To see him cut down like a flower!</div>
<div class="i1">On his travels we watch’d him next day,</div>
<div class="i2">O, the hangman I thought I could kill him!</div>
<div class="i1">Not one word did our poor Larry say,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor changed till he came to “King William:”</div>
<div class="i3">Och, my dear! then his colour turn’d white.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When he came to the nubbing cheat,</div>
<div class="i2">He was tuck’d up so neat and so pretty;</div>
<div class="i1">The rumbler jugg’d off from his feet,</div>
<div class="i2">And he died with his face to the city.</div>
<div class="i1">He kick’d too, but that was all pride,</div>
<div class="i2">For soon you might see ’twas all over;</div>
<div class="i1">And as soon as the noose was untied,</div>

<div class="i1">I ’ave quite lost the run of you lately. Bin playing some dark little game?</div>
<span class="pageno">278</span>
<div class="i1">I’m keeping mine hup as per usual, fust in the pick of the fun,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The latest new lay’s Demonstrations. You’ve heard on ’em, Charlie, no doubt,</div>
<div class="i1">For they’re at ’em all over the shop. <em>I</em>’ave ’ad a rare bustle about.</div>
<div class="i1">All my Saturday arfs are devoted to Politics. Fancy, old chump,</div>

<div class="i1">But Political Picnics mean sugar to them as is fly to wot’s wot.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Went to one on ’em yesterday, Charlie; a reglar old up and down lark.</div>
<div class="i1">The Pallis free gratis, mixed up with a old country fair in a park,</div>
<div class="i1">And Rosherville Gardens chucked in, with a dash of the Bean Feast will do,</div>
<div class="i1">To give you some little idear of our day with Sir Jinks Bottleblue.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Make much of us, Charlie? Lor bless you, we might ha’ bin blooming Chinese</div>
<div class="i1">A-doing the rounds at the ’Ealthries. ’Twas regular go as you please.</div>
<div class="i1">Lawn-tennis, quoits, cricket, and dancing for them as <em>must</em> be on the shove,</div>
<div class="i1">But I preferred pecking<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_284" id="fnanchor_284"></a><a href="#footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></span> and prowling, and spotting the mugs making love.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Don’t ketch <em>me</em> a-slinging my legs about arter a beast of a ball</div>
<div class="i1">At ninety degrees in the shade or so, Charlie, old chap, not at all.</div>
<div class="i1">Athletics ’aint ’ardly my form, and a cutaway coat and tight bags</div>
<div class="i1">Are the species of togs for yours truly, and lick your loose “flannels” to rags.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So I let them as liked do a swelter; I sorntered about on the snap.</div>
<div class="i1">Rum game this yer Politics, Charlie, seems arf talkee-talkee and trap.</div>
<div class="i1">Jest fancy old Bluebottle letting “the multitood” pic-nic and lark,</div>
<div class="i1">And make Battersea Park of his pleasure-grounds, Bathelmy Fair of his park!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“To show his true love for the People!” sez one vote-of-thanking tall-talker,</div>
<div class="i1">And wosn’t it rude of a bloke as wos munching a bun to cry “Walker!”?</div>
<div class="i1">I’m Tory right down to my boots, at a price, and I bellered “’Ear, ’ear!”</div>
<div class="i1">But they don’t cop yours truly with chaff none the more, my dear Charlie, no fear!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Old Bottleblue tipped me his flipper, and ’oped I’d “refreshed,” and all that.</div>
<div class="i1">“Wy rather,” sez I, “wot do <em>you</em> think?” at which he stared nto his ’at,</div>
<div class="i1">And went a bit red in the gills. Must ha’ thought me a muggins, old man,</div>
<div class="i1">To ask sech a question of ’Arry&mdash;as though grubbing short was <em>his</em> plan.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I went the rounds proper, I tell yer; ’twas like the free run of a Bar,</div>
<div class="i1">And Politics wants lots o’ wetting. Don’t ketch me perched up on a car,</div>
<div class="i1">Or ’olding a flag-pole no more. No, percessions, dear boy, ain’t my fad,</div>
<div class="i1">But Political Pic-nics with fireworks, and plenty of swiz ain’t ’arf bad.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The palaver was sawdust and treacle. Old Bottleblue buzzed for a bit,</div>
<div class="i1">And a sniffy young Wiscount in barnacles landed wot <em>’e</em> thought a ’it;</div>
<div class="i1">Said old Gladstone wos like Simpson’s weapon, a bit of a hass and all jor,</div>
<div class="i1">When a noisy young Rad in a wideawake wanted to give him wot for!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Yah! boo! Turn ’im hout!” sings yours truly, a-thinkin’ the fun was at ’and,</div>
<div class="i1">But, bless yer! ’twas only a sputter. I can’t say the meeting <em>looked</em> grand.</div>
<div class="i1">Five thousand they reckoned us, Charlie, but if so I guess the odd three</div>
<div class="i1">Were a-spooning about in the halleys, or lappin’ up buns and Bohea.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The band and the ’opping wos prime though, and ’Arry in course wos all there.</div>
<div class="i1">I ’ad several turns with a snappy young party with stror coloured ’air.</div>
<div class="i1">Her name she hinformed me wos Polly, and wen, in my ’appiest style,</div>
<div class="i1">I sez, “Polly is nicer than Politics!” didn’t she colour and smile?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">We got back jest in time for the Fireworks, a proper flare-up, and no kid,</div>
<div class="i1">Which finished that day’s Demonstration, an’ must ’ave cost many a quid.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_285" id="fnanchor_285"></a><a href="#footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></span></div>
<div class="i1"><em>Wot</em> fireworks and park-feeds <em>do</em> Demonstrate, Charlie, I’m blest if I see,</div>
<div class="i1">And I’m blowed if I care a brass button, so long as I get a cheap spree.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p>Mr. H. nabs the chance of putting his customers awake
that he has just made his escape from India, not forgetting
to clap his mawleys upon some of the right sort of stuff,
when on his return home he was stunned to find one of the
top Manufacturers of Manchester had cut his lucky, and
stepped off to the Swan Stream, leaving behind him a valuable
stock of Moleskins, Cords, Velveteens, Box Cloths,
Plushes, Doe Skins, Pilots, &amp;c., and having some ready in
his kick&mdash;grabbed the chance&mdash;stepped home with the swag&mdash;and
is now safely landed at his crib. He can turn out
Toggery very slap at the following low prices for</p>

Kicksies, built very slap with the artful dodge, a
canary. Pair of Bath or Worsted Cords, cut to drop down
on the trotters, a quid. Pair of out and out cords, built
very serious, 9 bob and a kick. Pair of stout Broad Cords,
built in the Melton Mowbray style, half a sov. Pair of
Moleskins, built hanky spanky, with double fakement down
the sides and artful buttons at the bottom, half a monarch.</p>

<p>The distinctions between <em>Slang</em> and <em>Cant</em> are well
defined by Hotten. “<em>Cant</em>,” he says, “is old, whilst
<em>Slang</em> is always modern and changing. To illustrate the
difference: a thief in <em>Cant</em> language would term a horse a
<em>Prancer</em> or <em>Prad</em>; while in <em>Slang</em> a man of fashion would
speak of it as a <em>Bit of Blood</em>, a <em>Spanker</em>, or a <em>neat tit</em>.”</p>

<p>Cant was formed for the purpose of secrecy in roguery,
Slang is commonly indulged in from a desire to appear
familiar with the life, gaiety, town humour, and street
jokes of the day. Cant and Slang are often used as
synonyms, which is erroneous, they are distinct terms,
and should be kept so.</p>

<p>Then there is what is commonly known as “Daily
Telegraphese,” or the “high falutin” style. This arose
from the invincible objection an inferior class of journalists
had to writing of a spade as a <em>spade</em>, it must be
called an “agricultural implement.” Examples of this
may be found any day in the leaders of the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>,
(London) a journal which whilst owned by Jews is
especially conspicuous for its cant about Christianity and
the Established Church. The parade of irrelevant learning,
the mythological allusions dug up from the almost
inaccessible depths of Lemprière, and the Latin verses
cheaply filched from Dictionaries of Quotations, can only
impose on imperfectly educated readers, to persons of
any literary culture they are simply nauseating.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_251">page 251</a> <cite>Jerry Juniper’s Chaunt</cite> (“Nix my dolly
pals”) was given, it is the somewhat abbreviated version
which is commonly sung, the full text, with a glossary,
will be found in Ainsworth’s entertaining novel <cite>Rookwood</cite>.</p>

<p>This work contains other cant songs, and in his Preface
Mr. Ainsworth makes the following remarks upon <span class="lock">them:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“As I have casually alluded to the flash song of Jerry
Juniper, I may be allowed to make a few observations upon
this branch of versification. It is somewhat curious with a
dialect so racy, idiomatic, and plastic as our own cant, that
its metrical capabilities should have been so little essayed.
The French have numerous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansons d’argot</i>, ranging from
the time of Charles Bourdigné and Villon down to that of
Vidocq and Victor Hugo, the last of whom has enlivened
the horrors of his “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dernier Jour d’un Condamné</i>” by a festive
song of this class. The Spaniards possess a large collection
of <cite>Romances de Germania</cite>, by various authors,
amongst whom Quevedo holds a distinguished place. We
on the contrary, have scarcely any slang songs of merit.
This barreness is not attributable to the poverty of the soil,
but to the want of due cultivation. Materials are at hand
in abundance, but there have been few operators. Dekker,
Beaumont and Fletcher, and Ben Jonson, have all dealt
largely in this jargon, but not lyrically; and one of the
earliest and best specimens of a canting-song occurs in
Brome’s ‘<cite>Jovial Crew</cite>;’ and in the ‘<cite>Adventures of Bamfylde
Moore Carew</cite>’ there is a solitary ode addressed by the
mendicant fraternity to their newly-elected monarch; but it
has little humour, and can scarcely be called a genuine canting-song.
This ode brings us down to our own time; to
the effusions of the illustrious Pierce Egan; to Tom Moore’s
Flights of ‘<cite>Fancy</cite>;’ to John Jackson’s famous chant, ‘<cite>On
the High Toby Spice flash the Muzzle</cite>,’ cited by Lord
Byron in a note to ‘<cite>Don Juan</cite>;’ and to the glorious Irish
ballad, worth them all put together, entitled ‘<cite>The Night
before Larry was stretched</cite>.’ This is attributed to the late
Dean Burrowes, of Cork. It is worthy of note, that almost
all modern aspirants to the graces of the <cite>Musa Pedestris</cite> are
Irishmen. Of all rhymesters of the ‘<cite>Road</cite>,’ however, Dean
Burrowes is, as yet, most fully entitled to the laurel. Larry
is quite ‘the potato!’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I venture to affirm that I have done something more than
has been accomplished by my predecessors, or contemporaries,
with the significant language under consideration. I
have written <em>a purely flash song</em>; of which the great and
peculiar merit consists in its being utterly incomprehensible
to the uninformed understanding, while its meaning must be
perfectly clear and perspicuous to the practised <em>patterer</em> of
<em>Romany</em>, or <em>Pedler’s French</em>. I have, moreover, been the
first to introduce and naturalize amongst us a measure which,
though common enough in the Argotic minstrelsy of France,
has been hitherto utterly unknown to our <em>pedestrian</em> poetry.
Some years after the song alluded to, better known under
the title of ‘<cite>Nix my dolly, pals,&mdash;fake away!</cite>’ sprang into
extraordinary popularity, being set to music by Rodwell,
and chanted by glorious Paul Bedford and clever little Mrs.
Keeley.”</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Ainsworth is in error in his claim to have
written the first purely flash song, if indeed that is what he
claims in his somewhat ambiguous sentence on the subject.</p>

<p>Detached Slang phrases may be found in the writings of
most of our principal novelists&mdash;in Swift, Addison, Henry
Fielding, Lord Lytton, Harrison Ainsworth, and Charles
Dickens they abound. Professor Wilson and Dr. Maginn
were also authorities on Slang.</p>

<p>Our older dramatists introduced Slang largely into
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
their plays, notably Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont
and Fletcher, Richard Brome, Thomas Middleton,
Thomas Decker, the Duke of Buckingham, and more
recently R. B. Sheridan and Moncrieff.</p>

<p>Our dear little friend <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> (London) contains
many hundreds of references, explanations, and
etymologies of Cant, Slang, and Flash, to which access
can be readily obtained by reference to the indices of that
ably conducted journal.</p>

<p>As a general remark on the songs which have been
quoted, it should be borne in mind that prior to 1829 the
punishment of death was inflicted for many offences which
are now considered trivial, hence the frequent references
they contain to hanging, and the gallows.</p>

at London, in Fletestret, at the signe of the Faulcon,

is generally acknowledged to have been the first work of
its kind, namely, an attempt to form a Cant Dictionary.
It was first printed in black letter, there have been
several later editions, and Hotten in his <cite>Slang Dictionary</cite>
reprints from it what he terms the “Rogues’ Dictionary.”

Cant, and Vulgar words</cite>, a second edition appeared in
1860; the above named which appeared in 1864,
contained much more matter than its predecessors.
There have been several editions published more
recently. Speaking in a general sense this appears to
be by far the most interesting, as it is also the most
useful work on <em>Slang</em> for modern readers. Naturally
it contains a few coarse and vulgar expressions, but
none of an obscene or indelicate description. It has a
bibliography of Slang and Cant, which is, however, incomplete.</p>

<p>Books on foreign slang are very numerous. Besides
those already mentioned the following are well known:&mdash;“Le
Jargon, ou Langage de l’Argot reformé,” &amp;c. (à
Troyés), par Yves Girardin, 1660; another by Antoine
Dubois, 1680; “Le Jargon ou Langage de l’Argot reformé,
pour l’instruction des bons Grivois,” &amp;c., à Lavergne, chex
Mezière, Babillandier du Grand Coëre, 1848; “Le Jargon
de l’Argot,” par Techener (several editions).</p>

<p>Alfred Delvau published his “Dictionnaire de la
Langue Verte, Argots Parisiens comparés,” in 1866, and
a second edition in 1867. A third “augmentée d’un
supplément par G. Fustier” appeared in 1883. The same
author published the “Dictionnaire Erotique Moderne”
in 1864. Other editions followed in 1874 and 1875.</p>

<p>Lorédan Larchey wrote “Les Excentricités de la
Langue Française” in 1860; the fourth edition appeared
in 1862. In 1872 the title was changed to “Dictionnaire
Historique Etymologique et Anecdotique de l’Argot
Parisien. Sixième Edition des Excentricités du Langage
mise à la hauteur des Revolutions du Jour.” In 1880 the
eighth edition was called “Dictionnaire Historique
d’Argot”; and a supplement appeared in 1883.</p>

<p>It has not been attempted here to give more than a
brief bibliography of the principal French works treating
of <em>Argot</em> in an explanatory, or historical manner.</p>

<p>Those who wish to pursue the subject further, and to
study examples, must consult the old poems of Maitre
Francois Villon and Molière, and the writings of
Rabelais, Beaumarchais, Eugene Sue, Victor Hugo,
Emile Zola, Champfleury, Honoré de Balzac, Pierre de
Brantôme, Alphonse Daudet, Emile Gaboriau, Charles
Nodier, Jean Richepin, and the classical Memoires de
Monsieur Vidocq.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Religious and Political Parodies.</h3>

<p>Those parodies which deal with Religious
and Political questions are alike in that they
are both of great antiquity, and that, no matter
how harmless they may be, they are sure to
displease a certain proportion of their readers.
Thus the parodies that were published by
William Hone were both religious and
political, and they gave great offence to the
supporters of the government of his day, yet
any history of English parody that should
omit the parodies which gave rise to his three
trials would be ridiculously incomplete. It is
difficult to adequately treat of the topic
without appearing to ridicule that which to
many appears too solemn for burlesque.</p>

<p>But in the following pages a broad distinction
has been drawn, those Parodies only have
been admitted which, whilst imitating the form
or language of portions of the liturgy, have no
tendency to ridicule religion in itself, nor to
burlesque any of its dogmas. It should be
remembered that much of the phraseology we
associate with the Liturgy is simply old
fashioned English, such as was in common use
at the time the Scriptures were translated into
English, and when the services of the Church
of England were first compiled. There can
therefore be nothing impious in applying
similar language to other subjects, and many
eminent churchmen have used the liturgical
forms of expression in answering and ridiculing
the arguments of their opponents.</p>

<p>There would be little difficulty in showing that in the matter
of Parodies no one creed has been less considerate of
their neighbours religious opinions than the Protestants, and
that, from the days of Luther, the Reformers have left no
weapon unemployed which could, in their opinion, do injury
to the older form of Catholicism.</p>

<p>When that pattern of filial devotion, Mary the Second,
came over with her husband to dispossess her father of his
kingdom, we read that he who, with all his faults, had been
a kind father, exclaimed “Heaven help me, since even my
own children desert me!” It was in the name of holy
Religion that James the Second was banished from this
country, and his enemies, to show how truly christianlike
they were, addressed the following poem to his daughter.
In this, not content with burlesquing one of the most beautiful
portions of the Catholic Church service, they compare
this Mary, descended from the Stuarts, with the Virgin
Mary.</p>

<p>The Parody of Scripture may be raised above mere travesty
by a vein of earnestness in the motive. Luther intended
no violence to the first Psalm when he thus parodied
<span class="lock">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the way of
the Sacramentarians, nor sat in the seat of the Zuringlians,
nor followed in the Council of the Zurichers.”</p>

<p>The same may be said of Dr. Norman Macleod’s parody
of the first chapter of <span class="lock">Genesis:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Perhaps the men of science would do well, in accordance
with the latest scientific results, and especially the ‘meteoric
theory’ to re-write the first chapter of Genesis in this <span class="lock">way:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
 <li>1. The earth was without form and void.</li>
 <li>2. A meteor fell upon the earth.</li>
 <li>3. The result was fish, flesh, and fowl.</li>
 <li>4. From these proceeded the British Association.</li>
 <li>5. And the British Association pronounced it tolerably good.”</li>

<p class="p2 center larger">William Hone’s Three Trials.</p>

<p>In the year 1817 William Hone, a printer
and publisher in the Old Bailey, London, was
prosecuted by the Government for having
printed and published three parodies, the first
was <em>John Wilkes’s Catechism of a Ministerial
Member</em>, the second was <em>The Political Litany</em>,
and the third was <em>The Sinecurist’s Creed</em>.</p>

<p>The first trial was held in the Guildhall, on December 17,
1817, before Mr. Justice Abbott and a Special Jury; the
second, also in the Guildhall, on December 19, 1817,
before Lord Ellenborough and a Special Jury, and the third
in the same place and before the same judge, on December
20, 1817.</p>

<p>In each case all the influence of Court and Government
was brought to bear against Mr. Hone, the Attorney-General
prosecuted, and the judges were distinctly adverse
to the defendant. Notwithstanding all this, and that Mr.
Hone, who defended himself without legal assistance, was
in feeble health, in each case the Juries returned a verdict
of <span class="sc">Not Guilty</span>, and their decisions were received with
delight and applause by the London populace.</p>

<p>Mr. Hone, in his defence, contended that the parodies
were harmless in themselves, were not intended to ridicule
religion or the scriptures, and were written for purely
political motives. He further contended, and indeed,
proved by extracts, that parodies of a far more objectionable
character than his were daily published without let or
hindrance, provided that they were in favour of the Government,
or written to abuse its opponents.</p>

<p>Directly after the trials Hone published a full account of
them, with his defences, and a quantity of entertaining
reading on the subject of religious and political parodies.
This book had an enormous sale, it has also been recently
reprinted by the <em>Freethought Publishing Company</em>, so that
copies of it can readily be obtained.</p>

<p>It will therefore suffice to give only the parodies themselves
here, without the evidence and speeches of the
trials.</p>

<p>A Catechism, that is to say, An Instruction, to be learned
of every person before he be brought to be confirmed a
Placeman or Pensioner by the Minister.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is your name?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Lick Spittle.</p>

<p>Q. Who gave you this name?</p>

<p>A. My Sureties to the Ministry, in my Political Change,
wherein I was made a Member of the Majority, the Child
of Corruption, and a Locust to devour the good Things of
this Kingdom.</p>

<p>Q. What did your Sureties then for you?</p>

<p>A. They did promise and vow three things in my Name.
First, that I should renounce the Reformists and all their
Works, the pomps and vanity of Popular Favour, and all
the sinful lusts of Independence. Secondly, that I should
believe all the Articles of the Court Faith. And thirdly,
that I should keep the Minister’s sole Will and Commandments,
and walk in the same, all the days of my life.</p>

<p>Q. Dost thou not think that thou art bound to believe
and to do as they have promised for thee?</p>

<p>A. Yes, verily, and for my own sake, so I will; and I
heartily thank our heaven-born Ministry, that they have
called me to this state of elevation, through my own flattery,
cringing, and bribery; and I shall pray to their successors
to give me their assistance, that I may continue the same
unto my life’s end.</p>

<p>Q. Rehearse the Articles of thy Belief.</p>

<p>A. I believe in <span class="sc">George</span>, the Regent Almighty, Maker of
New Streets, and Knights of the Bath,</p>

<p>And in the present Ministry, his only choice, who were
conceived of Toryism, brought forth of <span class="sc">William Pitt</span>,
suffered loss of Place under <span class="sc">Charles James Fox</span>, were
execrated, dead, and buried. In a few months they rose
again from their minority; they re-ascended to the Treasury
<span class="pageno">290</span>
benches, and sit at the right hand of a little man with a
large wig; from whence they laugh at the Petitions of
the People who may pray for Reform, and that the sweat
of their brow may procure them Bread.</p>

<p>I believe that King James the Second was a legitimate
Sovereign, and that King William the Third was not;
that the Pretender was of the right line; and that George
the Third’s grandfather was not; that the dynasty of
Bourbon is immortal! and that the glass in the eye of
Lord James Murray was not Betty Martin. I believe in
the immaculate purity of the Committee of Finance, in the
independence of the Committee of Secresy, and that the
Pitt System is everlasting, Amen.</p>

<p>Q. What dost thou chiefly learn in these Articles of
thy Belief?</p>

<p>A. First, I learn to forswear all conscience, which was
never meant to trouble me, nor the rest of the tribe of
Courtiers. Secondly, to swear black is white, or white
black, according to the good pleasure of the Ministers.
Thirdly, to put on the helmet of Impudence, the only
armour against the shafts of Patriotism.</p>

<p>Q. You said that your Sureties did promise for you,
that you should keep the Minister’s Commandments: tell
me how many there be?</p>

<p>A. Ten.</p>

<p>Q. Which be they?</p>

<p>A. The same to which the Minister for the time being
always obliges all his creatures to swear, I, the Minister,
am the Lord thy liege, who brought thee out of Want and
Beggary, into the House of Commons.</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Thou shalt have no other Patron but me.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Thou shalt not support any measure but mine, nor
shalt thou frame clauses of any bill in its progress to the
House above, or in the Committee beneath, or when the
mace is under the table, except it be mine. Thou shalt
not bow to Lord <span class="sc">Cochrane</span>, nor shake hands with him,
nor any other of my real opponents; for I thy Lord am a
jealous Minister, and forbid familiarity of the Majority,
with the Friends of the People, unto the third and fourth
cousins of them that divide against me; and give places,
and thousands and tens of thousands, to them that divide
with me, and keep my Commandments.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Thou shalt not take the Pension of thy Lord the
Minister in vain; for I the Minister will force him to accept
the Chilterns that taketh my Pension in vain.</p>

<p><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> Remember that thou attend the Minister’s Levee
day; on other days thou shalt speak for him in the House,
and fetch and carry, and do all that he commandeth thee
to do; but the Levee day is for the glorification of the
Minister thy Lord: In it thou shalt do no work in the
House, but shalt wait upon him, thou, and thy daughter,
and thy wife, and the Members that are within his influence;
for on other days the Minister is inaccessible, but delighteth
in the Levee day; wherefore the Minister appointed the
Levee day, and chatteth thereon familiarly, and is amused
with it.</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> Honour the Regent and the helmets of the Life
Guards, that thy stay may be long in the Place, which the
Lord thy Minister giveth thee.</p>

<p><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> Thou shalt not call starving to death murder.</p>

<p><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> Thou shalt not call Royal gallivanting adultery.</p>

<p><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> Thou shalt not say, that to rob the Public is to
steal.</p>

<p><abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> Thou shalt bear false witness against the people.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr> Thou shalt not covet the People’s applause, thou
shalt not covet the People’s praise, nor their good name,
nor their esteem, nor their reverence, nor any reward
that is theirs.</p>

<p class="p2">Q. What dost thou chiefly learn by these Commandments?</p>

<p>A. I learn two things&mdash;my duty towards the Minister,
and my duty towards myself.</p>

<p>Q. What is thy duty towards the Minister?</p>

<p>A. My duty towards the Minister is, to trust him as
much as I can; to fear him; to honour him with all my
words, with all my bows, with all my scrapes, and all my
cringes; to flatter him; to give him thanks; to give up my
whole soul to him; to idolize his name, and obey his
word; and serve him blindly all the days of his political
life.</p>

<p>Q. What is thy duty towards thyself?</p>

<p>A. My duty towards myself is to love nobody but
myself, and to do unto most men what I would not that
they should do unto me; to sacrifice unto my own
interest even my father and mother; to pay little
reverence to the King, but to compensate that omission
by my servility to all that are put in authority under
him; to lick the dust under the feet of my superiors, and
to shake a rod of iron over the backs of my inferiors; to
spare the People by neither word nor deed; to observe
neither truth nor justice in my dealings with them; to
bear them malice and hatred in my heart; and where
their wives and properties are concerned, to keep my
body neither in temperance, soberness, nor chastity, but
to give my hands to picking and stealing, and my tongue
to evil speaking and lying, and slander of their efforts
to defend their liberties and recover their rights; never
failing to envy their privileges, and to learn to get the
Pensions of myself and my colleagues out of the People’s
labour, and to do my duty in that department of public
plunder unto which it shall please the Minister to call
me.</p>

<p>Q. My good Courtier, know this, that thou art not able
of thyself to preserve the Minister’s favour, nor to walk in
his Commandments, nor to serve him, without his special
protection; which thou must at all times learn to obtain
by diligent application. Let me hear, therefore, if thou
canst rehearse the Minister’s Memorial.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Answer.</i></p>

<p>Our Lord who art in the Treasury, whatsoever be thy
name, thy power be prolonged, thy will be done
throughout the empire, as it is in each session. Give us
our usual sops, and forgive us our occasional absences on
divisions; as we promise not to forgive them that divide
against thee. Turn us not out of our places; but keep
us in the House of Commons, the land of Pensions and
Plenty; and deliver us from the People. Amen.</p>

<p>Q. What desirest thou of the Minister in this
Memorial?</p>

<p>A. I desire the Minister, our Patron, who is the disposer
of the Nation’s overstrained Taxation, to give his
protection unto me and to all Pensioners and Placemen,
that we may vote for him, serve him, and obey him, as far
as we find it convenient; and I beseech the Minister
that he will give us all things that be needful, both for our
reputation and appearance in the House and out of it;
that he will be favourable to us, and forgive us our
negligence; that it will please him to save and defend us,
in all dangers of life and limb, from the People, our
natural enemies; and that he will help us in fleecing and
grinding them; and this I trust he will do out of care for
himself, and our support of him through our corruption
and influence; and therefore I say Amen. So be it.</p>

<p><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
Q. How many Tests hath the Minister ordained?</p>

<p>A. Two only, as generally necessary to elevation;
(that is to say) Passive Obedience and Bribery.</p>

<p>Q. What meanest thou by this word Test?</p>

<p>A. I mean an outward visible sign of an inward
intellectual meanness, ordained by the Minister himself
as a pledge to assure him thereof.</p>

<p>Q. How many parts are there in this Test?</p>

<p>A. Two; the outward visible sign, and the intellectual
meanness.</p>

<p>Q. What is the outward visible sign or form of Passive
Obedience?</p>

<p>A. Dangling at the Minister’s heels, whereby the
person is degraded beneath the baseness of a slave, in
the character of a Pensioner, Placeman, Expectant
Parasite, Toadeater, or Lord of the Bedchamber.</p>

<p>Q. What is the inward intellectual meanness?</p>

<p>A. A death unto Freedom, a subjection unto perpetual
Thraldom; for being by nature born free, and the
children of Independence, we are hereby made children
of Slavery.</p>

<p>Q. What is required of persons submitting to the Test
of Passive Obedience?</p>

<p>A. Apostacy, whereby they forsake Liberty; and faith,
whereby they stedfastly believe the promises of the
Minister, made to them upon submitting to that Test.</p>

<p>Q. Why was the Test of Bribery ordained?</p>

<p>A. For the continual support of the Minister’s
influence, and the feeding of us, his needy creatures and
sycophants.</p>

<p>Q. What is the outward part or sign in the Test of
Bribery?</p>

<p>A. Bank notes, which the Minister hath commanded to
be offered by his dependants.</p>

<p>Q. Why then are beggars submitted to this Test, when
by reason of their poverty they are not able to go
through the necessary forms?</p>

<p>A. Because they promise them by their Sureties;
which promise, when they come to lucrative offices, they
themselves are bound to perform.</p>

<p>Q. What is the inward part, or thing signified?</p>

<p>A. The industry and wealth of the People, which are
verily and indeed taken and had by Pensioners and
Sinecurists, in their Corruption.</p>

<p>Q. What are the benefits whereof you are partakers
thereby?</p>

<p>A. The weakening and impoverishing the People,
through the loss of their Liberty and Property, while our
wealth becomes enormous, and our pride intolerable.</p>

<p>Q. What is required of them who submit to the Test
of Bribery and Corruption?</p>

<p>A. To examine themselves, whether they repent them
truly of any signs of former honour and patriotism, stedfastly
purposing henceforward to be faithful towards the
Minister; to draw on and off like his glove, to crouch to
him like a spaniel; to purvey for him like a jackall;
to be as supple to him as Alderman Sir <span class="sc">William Turtle</span>;
to have the most lively faith in the Funds, especially in the
Sinking Fund; to believe the words of Lord <span class="sc">Castlereagh</span>
alone; to have remembrance of nothing but what is
in the Courier; to hate <span class="sc">Matthew Wood</span>, the present
Lord Mayor, and his second Mayoralty; with all our heart,
with all our mind, with all our soul, and with all our
strength; to admire Sir <span class="sc">John Silvester</span>, the Recorder,
and Mr. <span class="sc">John Langley</span>; and to be in charity with those
only who have something to give.</p>

<p>Whosoever will be a Sinecurist: before all things it
is necessary that he hold a place of profit.</p>

<p>Which place except every Sinecurist do receive the salary
for, and do no service: without doubt it is no Sinecure.</p>

<p>And a Sinecurist’s duty is this: that he divide with the

<p>Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing with the

<p>For there is One Ministry of Old Bags,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_340" id="fnanchor_340"></a><a href="#footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></span> another of
Derry Down Triangle:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_341" id="fnanchor_341"></a><a href="#footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></span> and another of the Doctor.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_342" id="fnanchor_342"></a><a href="#footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></span>
But the Ministry of Old Bags, of Derry Down Triangle,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_343" id="fnanchor_343"></a><a href="#footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></span>
and of the Doctor, is all one: the folly equal, the profusion
coeternal.</p>

<p>Such as Old Bags is, such is Derry Down Triangle: and
such is the Doctor.</p>

<p>Old Bags a Mountebank, Derry Down Triangle a Mountebank:
the Doctor a Mountebank.</p>

<p>Old Bags incomprehensible, Derry Down Triangle incomprehensible:
the Doctor incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Old Bags a Humbug, Derry Down Triangle a Humbug:
and the Doctor a Humbug.</p>

<p>And yet they are not three Humbugs: but one Humbug.</p>

<p>As also they are not three incomprehensibles, nor three
Mountebanks: but one Mountebank, and one incomprehensible.</p>

<p>So likewise Old Bags is All-twattle,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_344" id="fnanchor_344"></a><a href="#footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></span> Derry Down
Triangle All-twattle: and the Doctor All-twattle.</p>

<p>And yet they are not three All-twattles: but one All-twattle.</p>

<p>So Old Bags is a Quack, Derry Down Triangle is a
Quack: and the Doctor is a Quack.</p>

<p>And yet they are not three Quacks: but one Quack.</p>

<p>So likewise Old Bags is a Fool, Derry Down Triangle is a
Fool: and the Doctor is a Fool.</p>

<p>And yet not three Fools: but one Fool.</p>

<p>For like as we are compelled by real verity to acknowledge
every Minister by himself to be Quack and Fool;</p>

<p>So are we forbidden by state etiquette to say there be
three Quacks, or three Fools.</p>

<p>Derry Down Triangle is made of none: neither born nor
begotten.</p>

<p>Old Bags is of himself alone; a Lawyer bred, a Lord
created, by the Father begotten.</p>

<p>The Doctor is of Old Bags, and of Derry Down Triangle:
neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</p>

<p>So there is one Old Bags, not three Old Bags: one Derry
Down Triangle, not three Triangles: one Doctor, not three
Doctors.</p>

<p>And in this ministry none is afore or after the other: none
is greater or less than another.</p>

<p>But the whole three Ministers are co-Charlatans together,
and co-Tricksters.</p>

<p>So that, in all things, as is aforesaid: the Majority with
the Ministry, and the Ministry in the Majority, is to be worshipped.</p>

<p>He therefore that will be a Sinecurist, must thus think of
the Ministry.</p>

<p>Furthermore it is necessary to his Sinecure’s preservation:
that he also believe rightly the mystification of Derry Down
Triangle.</p>

<p>For the Sinecurist’s right faith is, that he believe and
confess: that Derry Down Triangle, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">queue</i> of the
Ministry of the great man now no more, is now both
Minister and Manager.</p>

<p>Minister, first selling the substance of his own country to
this: Manager scattering the substance of this over all the
world;</p>

<p>Perfect Knave and perfect Fool: of unsparing despotic
views&mdash;on overstrained taxation subsisting;</p>

<p>Equal to Old Bags as touching grave Trickery: and inferior
to the Doctor as touching his Mummery.</p>

<p>Who although he be Knave and Fool, yet he is not two,
but one Minister;</p>

<p>One; not by a conversion of the Charlatan into the
Minister; but by shooting a more showy juggler, who wanted,
and still wants, to be a Minister.</p>

<p>One altogether; squandering in profusion our substance:
by votes of corrupt Majorities.</p>

<p>For as by power of Dupery, and our Money, he makes
whom he will his own; so by Intrigue and Cajolery, he is
<span class="lock">Minister:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Who to talk for our Salvation, descended to kiss the
Nethermost End of Tally-high-ho; and rose again as a giant
refreshed;</p>

<p>He ascended into a higher place, he sitteth at the right
hand of the Chair; from whence he shall hear how those
who being starved&mdash;‘by the Visitation of God’&mdash;became
Dead.</p>

<p>At whose nodding all Sinecurists shall rise again, and
again; and with their voices cry Aye! Aye! and the
Laureate<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_345" id="fnanchor_345"></a><a href="#footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></span> in token of joy, shall mournfully chaunt the most
doleful Lay in his Works.</p>

<p>And they that have said Aye! Aye! shall go into place
everlasting; and they that have said No! shall go into everlasting
Minorities.</p>

<p>And <span class="sc">Coleridge</span> shall have a Jew’s Harp, and a Rabbinical
Talmud, and a Roman Missal: and <span class="sc">Wordsworth</span>
shall have a Psalter, and a Primer, and a Reading Easy; and
unto <span class="sc">Southey’s</span> pension Sack-but shall be duly added: and
with Harp, Sack-but, and Psaltery, they shall make merry,
and discover themselves before Derry Down Triangle, and
<span class="sc">Hum</span> his most gracious Master, whose Kingdom shall have
no end.</p>

<p>This is the Sinecurist’s duty, from doing more than
which, except he abstain faithfully, he cannot be a Sinecurist.</p>

<p>Hone was then a poor, friendless man, whom the Government
meant to crush by fine and imprisonment in case of
conviction. But his triumphant acquittal on each of the
three trials had effects exactly opposite to those they anticipated.
The legality of his publications being fully established,
and public curiosity being aroused, large numbers of
the tracts were sold; Hone, instead of being ruined, found
himself the hero of the day, with public sympathy in his
favour, and a rapidly increasing business. The popular

purity of the Trial by Jury.</p>

<p>2. That the inestimable importance of the sacred and
constitutional right of Trial by Jury has never been more
demonstratively proved than by the recent prosecutions and
honourable acquittals of Mr. William Hone.</p>

<p>3. That Parodies on Scripture having been written and
published by Martin Luther, the Father of the Reformation,
by Dignitaries of the Church, and by other eminent and
learned personages down to the present time, we are persuaded
that the exception taken to the parodies of Mr. Hone by the
present Ministers of the Crown was to answer political
purposes against the Liberty of the Press.</p>

<p>4. That a hypocritical prostitution of Religion, and a
pretended zeal for its defence, when used by corrupt Statesmen
as a mask for political persecution, must ever be held
by all sincere Christians as the worst profanation of its
sacred name.</p>

<p>5. That it is evident, from the manner in which those
prosecutions were commenced and conducted, that the real
object of Ministers was not to protect Religion, but to
crush an apparently defenceless individual who had exposed
their political delinquencies, to stifle public discussion, to
destroy the Liberty of the Press, and to uphold existing
abuse.</p>

<p>6. That the extensive knowledge, the varied talents, the
manly intrepidity, the energy of mind, and the unshaken
perseverance, which enabled Mr. Willian Hone so dauntlessly
to resist the reiterated assaults of Ministerial persecution,
entitle him to the gratitude and support of every
friend to constitutional freedom.</p>

<p>7. That a subscription be now opened, and that the
money which may be subscribed be placed in the hands of
a Committee, to be used in such way as shall appear to
them best calculated to promote the permanent welfare of
Mr. Hone and his family.</p>

<p>8. That the following Gentlemen be of the Committee&mdash;Alderman
Goodbehere, Alderman Thorp, Robert Waithman,
Joseph Hurcombe, William Sturch, Samuel Brooks,
William Williams, William Teasdale.</p>

<p>9. That Robert Waithman, Esq., be the Treasurer.</p>

<p>10. That the Thanks of this Meeting are due to Sir
Francis Burdett, Bart., for his spontaneous offers of cooperation
with the Gentlemen originating the Subscription,
in strict conformity with a life of pure patriotism and love
of country.</p>

<p>11. That the Thanks of this Meeting are hereby
cordially given to Mr. Charles Pearson, for his manly and
successful struggle in correcting the corrupt system of
packing Juries, which has contributed so essentially toward
the present triumph; and especially for the gratuitous
advice and assistance given to Mr. Hone throughout the
whole of the prosecutions, affording a rare example to his
profession of zeal, independance, and disinterestedness.</p>

<p>12. That the Thanks of this Meeting be given to Lord
Cochrane, for his zealous endeavours on the present
occasion.</p>

<p class="quotesig">ROBERT WAITHMAN, Chairman.</p>

<p>13. That the Thanks of this Meeting be given to Mr.
Waithman, for his conduct in the Chair, and for his
exertions upon all occasions to support the cause of liberty.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Dish of Facts and Scraps.</span></p>

<p>Friends and fellow-countrymen, no matter where you
come from, or whether your mugs be black, white, or whitey
brown, you are called upon this day to assemble and meet
together to show your sympathy with suffering France, and
although we ought at all times to love our neighbours as
ourselves, yet it becomes us to look at home and take care
of number one.</p>

<p>Now the well-known sufferings of the children of France
have called forth the indignation of the Republicans of
England, and they held meetings with the view of showing
their sympathy for them.</p>

<p>And Nappy the Little was enjoying himself in the green
fields of Kent, and the Prussian Bully laughed in his sleeve,
saying “I will now let them alone, and they will be like
unto the Kilkenny cats, they will fight on till there is
nothing left but their precious tails.”</p>

<p>But the patriots of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Hall shouted, “Long live
the Republic!” and Georgy (Odger), the man of wax responded,
Amen!</p>

<p>Now about the same time the people of England were at
loggerheads with the shovel-hatted gentry that infest the
upper house of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, inasmuch as they had rejected
measures in spite of the people; and they said, it is
not only illegal, but it is naughty for a man to marry the
sister of a wife that is dead, excepting when it is to suit the
coronetted gentry, and then it is quite a horse of another
colour.</p>

<p>But the people communed together, saying, swallow the
bill you must, or we will bring in a bill for a man to marry
his grandmother, or off come your hats and silk aprons, and
we will pack you away to the salt lake to dwell amongst the
Mormons.</p>

<p>And Bruce, of cab flag notoriety, is doing his best to stop
a man’s beer, by trying to close the houses for the sale of
double stout. But he must mind his eye, or he will put his
foot in it, and his licensing dodge will share the same fate
as his never-to-be-forgotten cab act.</p>

<p>And the people said, who is he that interfereth with the
liberties of the working men. Better for him that he had a
millstone around his neck, and took a cold bath in the Serpentine.</p>

<p>And while these things were going on, Gladstone still
slumbered, showing that he is like a barber’s block, neither
use nor ornament.</p>

<p>Now behold, since the happy event of the wedding of the
lucky Scotchman with our charming little lady Louise, the
call for royal burgoo has been so great, that Scotch oatmeal
has risen 50 per cent.</p>

<p class="center">LET US SAY.</p>

<p>From all red hot babblers, who would cause us to burn our
fingers. Common sense defend us!</p>

<p class="p0 center"><i>Friends of peace and order save us!</i></p>

<p>From the tender mercies of such pious Kings as the
Prussian Bully, Minister of war spare us.</p>

<p class="p0 center"><i>Spare us, we implore thee.</i></p>

<p>And oh, ye silk aproned gentry, play not too much with
the rights of Englishmen, or you will be swept from the
floor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, and be compelled to earn an honest
living.</p>

<p>And O most noble Secretary for Home affairs, we beg of
you to throw up your present berth and turn teetotal spouter,
for which you are more fit, and not try to rob a poor man of
his beer by your new licencing dodge.</p>

<p class="p0 center"><i>Spare us our beer, we beseech thee.</i></p>

<p>And Odger, stop up the mouths of our numerous oppressors
with your lapstone of defiance, and spur up their shallow
minds with your closing awl of reason, and remain for ever
the true brick you always have been.</p>

<p>And O, Billy Gladstone, return to your duty as you
promised the Electors of Greenwich and the whole of the
working classes, or prepare to be sent to the imbecile ward
of the nearest union.</p>

<p>And now may a hot joint and a pot of home brewed
grace the tables of all who need it, and all our enemies be
vaccinated by Old Nick on both shoulders.</p>

<p class="quotesig">So be it.</p>

<p>The following are imitations of what is
“commonly called”</p>

<p class="center ls">THE CREED OF SAINT ATHANASIUS.</p>

<p>The first is taken from an old Collection
of poems, called “The Foundling Hospital for
Wit”:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Proper Rules and Instructions, Without which no
Person can be an Exciseman.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quicunque vult.</i></p>

<p>Whosoever would be an Exciseman, before all things it
is necessary that he learns the Art of Arithmetic.</p>

<p>Which Art, unless he wholly understand, he without
doubt can be no Exciseman.</p>

<p>Now the Art of Arithmetic is this, we know how to
multiply and how to divide. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Desunt pauca.</i></p>

<p>The 1 is a figure, the 2 a figure, and the 3 a figure.</p>

<p>The 1 is a number, the 2 a number, and the 3 a
number; and yet there are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Desunt plurima</i>.</p>

<p>For like as we are compelled by the Rules of Arithmetic,
to acknowledge every figure by itself to have signification
and form:</p>

<p>So we are forbidden, by the rules of right reason, to say,
that each of them have three significations or three powers.</p>

<p>The 2 is of the 1’s alone, not abstracted, nor depending,
but produced.</p>

<p>The 3 is of the 1 and 2, not abstracted, nor depending,,
nor produced, but derived. So there is one figure of 1.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Desunt nonnulla.</i></p>

<p>He therefore that will be an Exciseman, must thus
understand his figures.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to the preservation of his
place, that he also believe rightly the authority of his
Supervisor.</p>

<p>For his interest is, that he believes and confesses that
his <a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Supervisor, the servant of the Commissioners, is master
and man: Master of the Exciseman, having power from the
Commissioners to inspect his books: and man to the Commissioners,
being obliged to return his accounts.</p>

<p>Perfect master and perfect man, of an unconscionable
soul and frail flesh subsisting; equal to the Commissioners,
as touching that respect which is shown him by the
Excisemen, and inferior to the Commissioners as touching
their profit and salary.</p>

<p>Who, although he be master and man, is not two, but
one Supervisor.</p>

<p>One, not by confusion of place, but by virtue of his
authority; for his seal and sign manual perfect his commission;
his gauging the vessels, and inspecting the
Excisemens’ books, is what makes him Supervisor.</p>

<p>Who travels through thick and thin, and suffers most
from heat or cold, to save us from the addition of taxes, or
the deficiency in the funds, by corruption or inadvertency.</p>

<p>Who thrice in seven days goes his rounds, and once in
six weeks meets the Collectors, who shall come to judge
between the Exciseman and Victualler.</p>

<p>At whose coming all Excisemen shall bring in their
accounts, and the Victuallers their money.</p>

<p>And they that have done well by prompt payment, shall
be well treated.</p>

<p>And those that have done ill, by being tardy in their
payment, shall be cast into jail; and the Excisemen whose
books are blotted, or accounts unjustifiable, shall be turned
out of their places.</p>

<p>These are the rules, which except a man follows, he
cannot be an Exciseman.</p>

<p>Honour to the Commissioners, fatigue to the Supervisor,
and bribery to the Exciseman.</p>

<p>As it was from the beginning, when taxes were first laid
upon Malt, is now, and ever will be till the debts of the
nation are paid. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Matrimonial Creed.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>To be used in all dwelling houses.</i></p>

<p>Whoever will be married, before all things it is
necessary that he hold the conjugal faith, which is this,
That there were two rational beings created, both equal,
and yet one superior to the other; and the inferior shall bear
rule over the superior; which faith, except every one do
keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall be scolded
at everlastingly.</p>

<p>The man is superior to the woman, and the woman is
inferior to the man; yet both are equal, and the woman
shall govern the man.</p>

<p>The woman is commanded to obey the man, and the man
ought to obey the woman.</p>

<p><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span class="pageno">299</span>
And yet, they are not two obedients, but one obedient.</p>

<p>For there is one dominion nominal of the husband, and
another dominion real of the wife.</p>

<p>And yet, there are not two dominions, but one dominion.</p>

<p>For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to
acknowledge that wives must submit themselves to their
husbands, and be subject to them in all things;</p>

<p>So are we forbidden by the Conjugal Faith to say, that
they should be at all influenced by their wills or pay any
regard to their commands.</p>

<p>The man was not created for the woman, but the woman
for the man.</p>

<p>Yet the man shall be the slave of the woman, and the
woman the tyrant of the man.</p>

<p>So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the subjection of the
superior to the inferior is to be believed.</p>

<p>He, therefore, that will be married, must thus think of
the woman and the man.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to submissive Matrimony,
that he also believe rightly the infallibility of the wife.</p>

<p>For the right faith is, that we believe and confess, that
the wife is fallible and infallible.</p>

<p>Perfectly fallible, and perfectly infallible; of an erring
soul and unerring mind subsisting; fallible as touching
her human nature, and infallible as touching her female
sex.</p>

<p>Who, although she be fallible and infallible, yet she is
not two, but one woman; who submitted to lawful
marriage, to acquire unlawful dominion; and promised
religiously to obey, that she might rule in injustice and
folly.</p>

<p>This is the Conjugal Faith; which except a man believe
faithfully, he cannot enter the comfortable state of
Matrimony.</p>

<p>Whoever will be saved: before all things it is necessary
that he should hold the Chatham faith.</p>

<p>Which faith, except every man keep whole and undefiled
without doubt he shall sink into oblivion.</p>

<p>And the Chatham faith is this: that we worship one
Minister in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity:</p>

<p>Neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the
substance.</p>

<p>For the Privy Seal is a Minister, the Secretary is a
Minister, and the Treasurer is a Minister.</p>

<p>Yet there are not three Ministers, but one Minister; for
the Privy Seal, the Secretary, and the Treasurer are all
one.</p>

<p>Such as the Privy Seal is, such is the Secretary, and such
is the Treasurer.</p>

<p>The Privy Seal is self-create, the Secretary is self-create,
and the Treasurer is self-create.</p>

<p>The Privy Seal is incomprehensible, the Secretary is incomprehensible,
and the Treasurer is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The Privy Seal is unresponsible, the Secretary is unresponsible,
and the Treasurer is unresponsible.</p>

<p>And yet there are not three incomprehensibles, three self-created,
or three unresponsibles: but one incomprehensible,
one self-create, and one unresponsible.</p>

<p>For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity, to
acknowledge every person by himself to be God and
Lord;</p>

<p>So are we forbidden by the articles of the Chatham
alliance, to say there are three Ministers:</p>

<p>So that in all things, the Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in
Unity, are to be worshipped; and he who would be saved,
must thus think of the Ministry.</p>

<p>Furthermore it is necessary to elevation, that he also believe
rightly of the qualities of our Minister.</p>

<p>For the right faith is, that we believe and confess, that
this son of man is something more than man; as total
perfection, though of an unreasonable soul, and gouty flesh
consisting.</p>

<p>Who suffered for our salvation, descended into opposition,
rose again the third time, and ascended into the House of
Peers.</p>

<p>He sitteth on the right hand of the &mdash;&mdash;, from whence
he shall come to judge the good and the bad.</p>

<p>And they that have done good, shall go into patent
places, and they that have done bad, shall go into everlasting
opposition.</p>

<p>This is the Chatham faith; which except a man believe
faithfully, he cannot be promoted.</p>

<p>As he was in the beginning, he is now, and ever will be.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Then all the people, standing up, shall say</i>,</p>

Minister, have mercy on us miserable subjects.</p>

<p>One Bill holds the Field, not Another in the Field, so the
rest nowhere.</p>

<p>One Gladstone Incomprehensible, One William Incomprehensible,
and One Bill Incomprehensible.</p>

<p>And yet there are not Three Bills, but One Bill;</p>

<p>As also there are not Three Premiers, nor Three Incomprehensibles,
but One Premier Incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Who begets invisible principle and policy of Himself, the
only unimpeachable authority.</p>

<p>For like as we are compelled by the Gladstonian Faith
to acknowledge all his policy to be great, good and
gracious,</p>

<p>So we are forbidden by the Gladstonian Religion to say
there be Queen, Cabinet, Lords or Commons;</p>

<p>And in this faith One is Afore and never after Another;
One is Greater never less than another.</p>

<p>So that in all things as aforesaid, Verbosity against
Unity&mdash;Surrender to Malignity&mdash;is to be worshipped.</p>

<p>Furthermore it is necessary for proper Qualification
that he also believe rightly the mystification of the Grand
Old Man.</p>

<p>For the right faith is that we believe and confess that
the People’s William does good for mankind;</p>

<p>That he is perfect Genius and perfect Man and yet a
reasonable Soul on Destructive Acts subsisting;</p>

<p>Equal to no one in Love of Office, and inferior to none
in Design to retain it.</p>

<p>For as this reasonable Soul is Flesh and Blood, so
Flesh and Blood cannot understand this reasonable Soul.</p>

<p>Who will permit any to suffer for his Salvation, and
who hopes to rise again with his Bills from the Dead;</p>

<p>And whosoever follows shall enter as a Gladstonian
politician, and he that does not may sink into political
oblivion.</p>

<p>This is the Gladstonian faith, which except a man
believe faithfully he cannot be elected.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass in the 15th year of the reign of

the month at Even, that a deep sleep came upon me, the
visions of the night possessed my spirit, I dreamed, and

generation to generation! but behold now the power which
thou gavest unto thy servant is at an end, the Peterborough

<p>Q. What is your name?</p>

<p>A. A Freeman.</p>

<p>Q. Who gave you this name?</p>

<p>A. The Candidates for a seat in the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>Q. Wherein does your Freedom consist?</p>

<p>A. First. In having the liberty to eat, drink, and
revel in debauchery, from the commencement of the canvass
to the close of the poll, let that time be what it may;&mdash;and
all that on <em>free cost</em>.</p>

<p>Secondly. In giving my vote to that Candidate or his
friends, whom I shall conceive the most likely to serve my
own <em>private</em> interest, without any regard to the comparative
merits of the Candidates, or the welfare and prosperity of
this Town and Kingdom.</p>

<p>Q. What sort of morality do you call this?</p>

<p>A. This I call political morality; and it is this morality
which has the greatest influence on the conduct of very
many electors.</p>

<p>Q. Are there no electors who vote on other principles?</p>

<p>A. Yes: there are some who think, judge, and compare
before they promise; and then give their suffrage, so
that their hearts may not reproach them, for a violation of
those principles of morality, which ought to regulate the
conduct of every man, especially if he professes to be a
<em>Christian</em>.</p>

<p>Q. Is this promise binding, which has been obtained on
a false statement of facts?</p>

<p>A. All Casuists say <em>No</em>; especially if it be to the injury
of a third person.</p>

<p><span class="sc">N.B.</span> <span class="sc">Freemen</span>, it must be well-known to you, that
<span class="sc">Henry Brougham</span> and <span class="sc">Thomas Creevey</span> are the

October 1812.</p>

<p>The Candidates were the Rt. Hon. George Canning;

Creevey; and Gen. B. Tarlton. (Messrs. G. Canning and

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Income-Tax Catechism.</span></p>

<p>Q. Why is the Income and Property-Tax so called?</p>

<p>A. Because it is a tax on the mere Income of some
people, and on the whole Property of others.</p>

<p>Q. Of whom is it a tax on the Income only?</p>

<p>A. It is a tax on the Income only, and on no more
than the Income, of those whose Income consists of rent,
or of the interest of Property.</p>

<p>Q. Of whom is it a tax on the entire Property?</p>

<p>A. It is a tax on the entire Property of those whose
Income consists of earnings, and who have no other
Property than their Income.</p>

<p>Q. So it is called an Income-Tax when it is a tax on
Income arising from Property, and a Property-Tax when
it is a tax on Income not arising from Property?</p>

<p>A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. If persons whose Income consists merely of earnings
were taxed in the same proportion as those whose
Incomes consist of dividends or of rents, how much Income-Tax
would they have to pay?</p>

<p>A. At the utmost, sixteen pence in the pound on the
interest of their yearly incomes at 3 per cent. For instance,
a man earning £500 a year would have to pay 20s.</p>

<p>Q. Would this be an equitable adjustment of the
Income-Tax?</p>

<p>A. Not quite; because earnings are mostly precarious.</p>

<p>Q. How does the Income-Tax affect persons of precarious
income?</p>

<p>A. It deprives them of the money which they ought
to save as a provision against a season of loss of employment,
or against old age.</p>

<p>Q. Where do those people go who are incapacitated
by the Income-Tax from making a provision for loss of
employment, or for old age?</p>

<p>A. To the workhouse.</p>

North Essex; Ex-Tory Whipper-in, Secretary-at-War

<p>Q. What is a rabble?</p>

<p>A. Rabble is a congregation of creatures that hiss and
hoot.</p>

<p>Q. Biped or quadruped?</p>

<p>A. I believe, biped.</p>

<p>Q. Of what are they ordinarily composed?</p>

<p>A. Mud, tempered with ditch-water. Sometimes they
are made of road-scrapings; they are sometimes found of
pure clay.</p>

<p>Q. What is your duty towards the rabble?</p>

<p>A. My duty towards the rabble is, from the very
bottom of my heart (wherever that may be) to loathe,
detest, hate, and abhor them.</p>

<p>Q. As everything has its place in the condition of the
world, what&mdash;in your opinion&mdash;in the scale of creation, is
the proper place of the rabble? Take, for instance, an
individual. <em>One</em> of the rabble?</p>

<p>A. I believe that one of the rabble is a&mdash;yes&mdash;a sort of
link between an ape and a contented labourer. I have, I
think, read of apes that chop sticks and draw water, and
walk upright on two legs; I have no doubt that moral
anatomy would establish the analogy. No doubt of it.
Yes; one of the rabble is a link between an ape and a
labourer&mdash;a contented labourer.</p>

<p>Q. Has the rabble any voice?</p>

<p>A. Certainly not: it is the want of voice that is the
rabble’s distinguishing want.</p>

<p>Q. But supposing that the rabble could, by Act of
Parliament, for instance, obtain voices&mdash;they would then
be rabble no longer?</p>

<p>A. Certainly not.</p>

<p>Q. The rabble, having no articulate voices, you conceive
it to be your bounden duty to hate, and, from the
bottom of your heart despise them?</p>

<p>A. I do.</p>

<p><span class="pageno">31</span>
Q. But, having obtained voices, the rabble would then
be to <span class="lock">you&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A. Every one of them a man and a brother; that is&mdash;at
Election times. Yes; from the bottom of my heart, a
man and a brother.</p>

<p>Q. What are you?</p>

<p>A. One o’ the rabble</p>

<p>Q. What makes you of the rabble?</p>

<p>A. Nothin’ makes me; got nothin’; that’s why nothin’
does it.</p>

<p>Q. What is your place in the world?</p>

<p>A. Got no place by rights; only what the gentlefolks
is so kind&mdash;heaven bless ’em&mdash;is so kind to grant me.</p>

<p>Q. What are your duties in life?</p>

<p>A. My duties is to pay duties on ’bacca, and on whatsomever
there may be put upon&mdash;tea and beer and so
forth&mdash;and ax no questions.</p>

<p>Q. Have you any voice at elections?</p>

<p>A. Yes: when I hollars.</p>

<p>Q. But you have no vote?</p>

<p>A. In course not. ’Cause I’m one o’ the rabble.</p>

<p>Q. And as one of the rabble&mdash;what are you to expect
from the gentlemen who propose themselves&mdash;for the
benefit of the country&mdash;to be Members of Parliament?</p>

<p>A. I am to expect, and not a bit to mind it, to be despised
from the bottom of their hearts.</p>

<p>Q. Were you created for that?</p>

<p>A. I was, as badgers were made to be baited, foxes to
be hunted, and hedgehogs to be beaten to bits&mdash;so was
the rabble made to be despised by Members of Parliament,
’specially when majors, from the very bottom of
their hearts.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Catechism for Londoners.</span></p>

<p>Q. What is a Premium?</p>

<p>A. Premium is a Latin word meaning “prize” or
“reward.” In London this reward is given by Landlords
to themselves out of the money of incoming Tenants.</p>

<p>Q. Is a Premium a prize for good conduct?</p>

<p>A. Exclusively so. The good conduct consists in
allowing Tenants to live in London at all.</p>

<p>Q. Is the moment when a house is taken the only occasion
on which a Premium is exacted?</p>

<p>A. Not at all. When a lease expires, Landlords, especially
Ducal ones (see Mr. <span class="sc">Platt’s</span> evidence before the
Parliamentary Committee), often refuse to renew without a
heavy Premium.</p>

<p>Q. Is it a valid plea to say that this Premium is a
repayment to the Landlord for improvements which he has
kindly made in the house?</p>

<p>A. No; because the Landlord hardly ever makes any
improvements.</p>

<p>Q. Then, at any rate, Tenants of London houses can
always have the advantage of a lease, if they like to pay a
Premium for it?</p>

<p>A. Such is not the case. Some Ducal Landlords now
exact Premiums, and at the same time refuse to grant
leases.</p>

<p>Q. Then the Tenant becomes a mere Tenant-at-will?</p>

<p>A. Unless he prefers to become a Tenant-at-won’t, and
leaves the house in disgust.</p>

<p>Q. Why do not all Tenants adopt the latter system?</p>

<p>A. Because to leave his place of business may mean to
a tradesman the sacrifice of his “connection,” a fact of
which Landlords take full advantage.</p>

<p>Q. If a Tenant asked his Landlord for compensation
for improvements executed by himself, what would the
latter do?</p>

<p>A. Improve him off the estate, probably.</p>

<p>Q. When a London Landlord destroys at one blow the
value of a Tradesman’s good-will, by refusing him a lease,
and drives him to emigrate by exacting a “starvation-rent,”
what does he call the result to the Tenant?</p>

<p>A. A happy re-lease.</p>

<p>Q. What is the theoretical foundation on which Ducal
Landlords build their claim to rack-rent all occupiers who
“hold of” them?</p>

<p>A. That it is entirely owing to their own careful attention
and unremitting exertions that the soil of London is
now of any value whatever.</p>

<p>Q. And of what material is that foundation largely
composed?</p>

<p>A. Portland Cement.</p>

<p>Q. What would the Ducal monopoly of land and houses
in the best situations in London be called in Chicago?</p>

<p>A. A “corner in rents.”</p>

<p>Q. And what would be an appropriate name for the
victim of this monopoly?</p>

<p>A. A <em>Ground</em>-Tenant.</p>

<p>Q. Although the Ducal system of “improving estates,”
by turning out old Tenants and raising the rent to the
utmost possible limit, may press hardly on individuals, do
not these territorial magnates display a splendid example of
public-spirited generosity and self-denying civic virtue which
compensates for private loss?</p>

<p>A. Scarcely.</p>

cannot be got rid of in any other way.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Drunkard’s Catechism.</span></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;What is your name?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Drunken Sot.</p>

<p>Q.&mdash;Who gave you that name?</p>

<p>A.&mdash;As drink is my idol, landlords and their wives get
all my money; they gave me that name in my drunken
sprees wherein I was made a member of strife, a child of
want, and an inheritor of a bundle of rags.</p>

<p>Q.&mdash;What did your landlords and landladies promise for
you.</p>

<p>A.&mdash;They did promise and vow three things in my name,
first, that I should renounce the comfort of my own fireside;
secondly, starve my wive and hunger my children;
thirdly, walk in rags and tatters, with my shoe soles going
flip flap all the days of my life.</p>

<p>Q.&mdash;Rehearse the articles of thy belief.</p>

<p>A.&mdash;I believe in the existence of one Mr. Alcohol, the
great head and chief of all manner of vice, the source of
nine-tenths of all diseases! and I not only believe, but am
sure that when my money is gone and spent, the landlord
will stop the tap and turn me out.</p>

<p><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
Q.&mdash;How many commandments have ye sots to keep?</p>

<p>A.&mdash;Ten.</p>

<p>Q.&mdash;Which be they?</p>

<p>A.&mdash;The same which the landlord and landlady spake in
the bar, saying, We are thy master and thy mistress who
brought thee out of the paths of virtue, placed thee in the
ways of vice, and set thy feet on the road which leadeth to
New South Wales.</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt use no other house but mine.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt not make to thyself any substitute for
intoxicating drinks, such as tea, coffee, ginger-pop and
lemonade; for I am a jealous man, wearing the coat that
should be on thy back, eating thy children’s bread, and
pocketing the money which should make thee and thy wife
happy all the days of thy life.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt not use my house in vain.</p>

<p><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>&mdash;Remember that thou eat but one meal on the
Sabbath day. Six days shalt thou drink and spend all thy
money, but the seventh day is the Sabbath, wherein I wash
my floor, mend my fires and make ready for the company
the remaining part of the day.</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt honor the landlords, the landladies and
the gin-shops, with thy presence that thy days may be few
and miserable, in the land wherein thou livest.</p>

<p><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt commit murder, by starving, hungering
and beating thy wife and family.</p>

<p><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt commit self-destruction.</p>

<p><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt sell thy wife’s and children’s bread
and rob thyself of all thy comforts.</p>

<p><abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt bear false witness when thou speakest
of the horrors, saying, Thou art in good health when
labouring under the barrel fever.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr>&mdash;Thou shalt covet all thy neighbour is possessed of;
thou shalt covet his house, his land, his purse, his health,
his wealth, and all that he has got, that thou mayest
indulge in drunkenness, help the brewer to buy a new
coach, a pair of fine horses, a new dray, and a fine
building, that he may live in idleness all his days; likewise
to enable the landlord to purchase a new sign to place over
his door, with “Licensed to be drunk on the Premises”
written thereon.</p>

<p class="p2">The foregoing are only a few of the many imitations of
the Catechism, others are either too long to quote, or not
sufficiently interesting.</p>

<p>There was one published during the Regency, entitled
“<cite>A Political Catechism</cite>, dedicated (without permission) to
His most Serene Highness <cite>Omar Bashaw</cite>, Bey and
Governor of the Warlike City and Kingdom of Algiers;
the Earl of Liverpool, Lord Castlereagh, and <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>”
<cite>Coventry</cite>: J. Turner. Price Twopence. It was also
published in London, by R. Carlile, 1817.</p>

<p>This was written to urge the people to petition the Prince
Regent for Parliamentary, and Constitutional Reform.</p>

<p>Another, which was published about three years ago, was
styled “<cite>The Conservative Catechism</cite>, or, the Principles of
Organised Hypocrisy Explained.” This was issued, at the
low price of one penny, by Abel Heywood &amp; Son,
Manchester, and had a large sale among the Radical voters
at the time of the last Election.</p>

<p>The following parody occurred in a sermon
preached at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s Cross during the reign
of James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, by Dr. John Boys, Dean of
<span class="lock">Canterbury:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Our Pope, which art in Rome, cursed be thy name;
perish may thy kingdom; hindered may thy will be, as it is
in heaven, so in earth. Give us this day our cup in the
Lord’s Supper; and remit our moneys which we have given
for thy indulgencies, as we send them back unto thee; and
lead us not into heresy; but free us from misery; for thine
is the infernal pitch and sulphur, for ever and ever. Amen.”</p>

<p>This was printed in Jefferson’s <cite>Entertaining Literary
Curiosities</cite>, 1808, and was also referred to by Hone in his
trials.</p>

<p>A long article appeared in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, August 8,
1885, devoted to the history of the Lord’s Prayer, with
variations, paraphrases, imitations, and translations. It
gave two curious versions of the Prayer in very early
English.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The <abbr title="Ten">X</abbr> Commandments of the Canting Crew.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most whimsical laws that were ever prescribed
to a gang of thieves were those framed by William
Holliday, one of the prigging community, who was hanged
in 1695:&mdash;</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> That none of his company should presume to wear
shirts, upon pain of being cashiered.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> That none should lie in any other places than
stables, empty houses, or other bulks.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> That they should eat nothing but what they
begged, and that they should give away all the money
they got by cleaning boots among one another, for the
good of the fraternity.</p>

<p><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> That they should neither learn to read nor write,
that he may have them the better under command.</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> That they should appear every morning by nine on
the parade, to receive necessary orders.</p>

<p><abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> That none should presume to follow the scent but
such as he ordered on that party.</p>

<p><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> That if any one gave them shoes or stockings, he
should convert them into money to play.</p>

<p><abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> That they should steal nothing they could not
come at, for fear of bringing a scandal upon the company.</p>

<p><abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> That they should not endeavour to clear themselves
of vermin, by killing or catching them.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr> That they should cant better than the Newgate
birds, pick pockets without bungling, outlie a Quaker,
outswear a lord at a gaming-table, and brazen out all
their villanies beyond an Irishman.</p>

People of Great Britain.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>After the Passing of the Allopathic Trades Union Medical
Bill, of 1877</i>,</p>

<p>1st. I am thy Family Doctor, duly appointed by the
state. I brought thee into this world of sorrow, and so
long as thou livest, to thee, in matters medical, it must be
a land of bondage.</p>

<p><abbr title="second">2nd.</abbr> Thou shalt have none other Doctor but me.</p>

<p><abbr title="third">3rd.</abbr> Thou shalt not make for thyself any medicine;
nor gather any herbs that grow upon the earth, nor in the
waters about the earth; thou shalt not use anything,
however simple, in treating disease: for I, thy Doctor, am
a very jealous man, and for any infraction of this, thy
duty, I will visit thy transgression with pains and penalties;
yea, I will incarcerate thee into a prison, and so
punish for thy doings, those dependent upon thee.
And if thou wilt blindly follow my advice, and pay obedience
to me, I will promise thee, when ill, that I will bleed,
blister, and salivate thee at my pleasure; and so reward
thee with a ruined constitution, to drag out a miserable
existence for the remainder of thy days.</p>

<p>4th. Thou shalt not speak lightly of my name, for I am
protected by law; and the law will not hold him guiltless
that interferes in any way with me.</p>

<p>5th. Remember that thou prayest for my welfare when
attending thy church on the sabbath day. Six days shalt
thou labour to prostrate thy body and work for my fees;
but the seventh day is the sabbath, and on that day thou
must do nothing towards restoring or improving thy
health, or thy wife’s health, or thy children’s health, or
above all, thy neighbour’s health; nor must thou think
about it, it is something that does not concern thee, I
claim that as my special privilege&mdash;state protected. I am
all powerful in these matters, and as such must be
respected.</p>

<p>6th. Honour thy Doctor more than anyone else, for I
claim thee, body and soul, whilst residing in England, the
land of thy birth.</p>

<p>7th. Thou shalt not think for thyself.</p>

<p>8th. Thou art an Englishman, and the law hath handed
thee over to my tender keeping.</p>

<p>9th. Thou shalt never be a Doctor.</p>

<p>10th. Thou shalt not tell thy neighbour of any remedy
that will do him good, for I shall watch thy doings
jealously. Thou shalt never covet the position of a
medical adviser. If thou seest thy neighbour suffering,
or his wife suffering, or any of his children suffering and
thou art in possession of any remedy that will do them
good, thou shalt not advise, nor use it; for I, thy Doctor,
state protected, am always watchful, to visit upon thee
pains and penalties for any infraction of these my commandments.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Mr. William Hone was
a printer and publisher, named Richard Carlile,
who, in 1817, had a shop at 183, Fleet Street,
London.</p>

<p>He dealt largely in similar publications to those sold by
Hone, and indeed reprinted the very parodies for publishing
which Hone had been tried and acquitted. Like Hone,
too, he was prosecuted by the Government of the day, and
in October, 1819, was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment
and to pay fines of £1,000 and £500 respectively,
for publishing Paine’s “Age of Reason” and Palmer’s
“Principles of Nature.” As he would not, or could not,
pay these heavy fines, he was kept in prison until 1825.</p>

<p>Carlile republished <cite>Wat Tyler</cite>, a work which had been
written by Robert Southey, when an ardent young Republican,
but which, when he became Poet Laureate, and a
pensioner of the Tory Government, he was very anxious
should be forgotten. Southey endeavoured to prohibit
the republication, but to no purpose, and over twenty-five
thousand copies of the work were sold. Carlile also edited
<cite>The Republican</cite>, <cite>The Lion</cite>, <cite>The Gauntlet</cite>, <cite>The Christian
Warrior</cite>, and other publications. He was born at Ashburton
in 1790, and died in 1843; his body, after having
been dissected at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas’s Hospital at his own request,
was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.</p>

<p>Even those who agreed with Carlile’s very advanced
theories were compelled to admit that he was a most
eccentric individual, and his publications are decidedly inferior
in literary merit to those issued by Hone. One of
these was entitled <cite>The Bullet Te Deum with the Canticle of
the Stone</cite>, 1817, a political parody of “Te Deum
Laudamus.” He published another two-penny political
pamphlet (ascribed to Professor Porson), called “<cite>A New
Catechism for the use of the Swinish Multitude</cite>. Necessary
to be had in all Sties.” This was written partly in answer
to Burke’s celebrated essay on the Sublime and the
Beautiful. But of all Carlile’s political parodies probably
the following was the best. It was <span class="lock">entitled&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Order for the</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Administration of the Loaves and Fishes</i>; or,</p>

<p class="center">The Communion of Corruption’s Host;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Diligently corrected and revised</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Commanded to be read at the Treasury the day preceding
all Cabinet Dinners.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Order</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><abbr title="paragraph marker">¶</abbr> So many as intend to be partakers of the <span class="sc">Loaves</span> and
<span class="sc">Fishes</span>, shall signify their names to the Chief Minister, at
least some days before the meeting of Parliament.</p>

<p><abbr title="paragraph marker">¶</abbr> And if any one of these be an open hearted and
upright character, or have not done any wrong to the
people, by word or deed, so that he be not like unto the
<span class="sc">Host of Corruption</span>; the Minister having knowledge
thereof, shall call him, and advertise him, that in anywise
he presume not to be a partaker of the <span class="sc">Loaves</span> and <span class="sc">Fishes</span>,
until he hath openly declared himself to have truly repented
and amended his former naughty life, that <span class="sc">Corruption’s
Host</span> may thereby be satisfied, which before were offended;
and that he hath recompensed the parties, by declaring
himself to be in readiness so to do, as soon as he
conveniently may.</p>

<p><abbr title="paragraph marker">¶</abbr> The same order shall the Minister use with those
betwixt whom he perceiveth malice and hatred to reign;
not suffering them to be partakers of the <span class="sc">Loaves</span> and
<span class="sc">Fishes</span>, until he know them to be reconciled. And if one
of the parties so at variance be content to forgive, from the
bottom of his heart, all that the other hath trespassed
against him, and to make amends for that he himself hath
offended; and the other party will not be persuaded to a
Ministerial unity, but remain still in frowardness and the
<span class="sc">Opposition</span>: The Minister, in that case, ought to admit
the penitent person to a share of the plunder, and not him
that is obstinate. Provided that every Minister so repelling
any, as is specified in this or the next paragraph of this
Rubrick, shall be obliged to give an account of the same to
the <span class="sc">Cabinet</span>, within fourteen days after, at the farthest.
And the <span class="sc">Cabinet</span> shall prevent the offending person
from receiving either <span class="sc">Sinecure</span>, <span class="sc">Pension</span>, or <span class="sc">Place of
Profit</span>.</p>

<p><abbr title="paragraph marker">¶</abbr> The Table at the Cabinet dinner having a fair white
damask cloth upon it, shall be covered with every luxury
<span class="pageno">31</span>
the earth produceth, and all Members to be there invited
that shall accede to the foregoing rules, at least seven days
before the opening of Parliament, there to hear repeated
the Regent’s Speech, and Address thereon, and to rehearse
the debates that shall be made on the said Speech and
Address, also to be well acquainted with the amendment
that shall be proposed by <span class="sc">Corruption’s best allies</span>,
the <span class="sc">Whigs</span>. Dinner being over, the Minister at the head
of the table shall first repeat the Regent’s speech as
<span class="lock">followeth:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We lament that our Father<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_347" id="fnanchor_347"></a><a href="#footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></span> is still secluded, hallowed
be thy name, Our kingdom come, our will be done in
France and Ireland, as it is in Great Britain. Give us this
year, our women and wine, and forgive us our debts, that
we may be enabled to satisfy those to whom we are indebted.
And lead us not into danger, but deliver us from
the disaffected. Amen.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Address.</span></p>

<p>High and mighty Prince, unto whom our hearts are
open, our desires known, and from whom our secrets are
not hid, gratify the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration
of thy goodly Places and Pensions, that we may perfectly
love thee, and worthily magnify thy name; through the
mediation of Castlereagh our Chief. Amen.</p>

<p><abbr title="paragraph marker">¶</abbr> Then shall the Minister, turning to the <span class="sc">Host</span>, rehearse
distinctly, all the <span class="sc">Ten Commandments</span>; and the <span class="sc">Host</span>,
sitting open-mouthed, shall, after every Commandment, ask
the Prince mercy for their transgressions thereof for the
time past, and a Pension to keep the same for the time to
come, as followeth:</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> The Prince spake these words, and said; I
am the Prince thy Ruler: thou shall seek no other Prince
but me.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O Ministers, place a Pension upon us, that will
incline our hearts to keep this law.</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven
image of Bonaparte, nor a caricature likeness of any thing
belonging to the Court or its Minions. Thou shalt not
express pleasure at seeing them in the houses of others; for
I the Prince thy Ruler am a jealous Prince, and intend to
protract the wretchedness of the Fathers upon the Children,
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
and to extend sinecure-offices and pensions unto thousands
in them that love me, and keep my commandments.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O Ministers, be lavish upon us, and incline our
hearts to keep this law.</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> Thou shalt not expose the name or character
of the Prince thy Ruler to contempt, for the Prince will not
hold him guiltless, that speaketh disrespectfully of him.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O Ministers procure us a title, to incline our
hearts to keep this law.</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> Remember that thou attend the division; at
all other times thou mayst be absent, and do that thou
hast to do, but to be in the division is thy duty to the
Prince. In it thou shalt do as the Minister doth, for his
majority compensates for his want of ability, and enableth
him to create, or destroy; to suspend the laws, or enact
new ones; to keep a large Army to stifle the cries of the
hungry, to use the bayonet, instead of granting Reform;
wherefore the Minister blesseth the majority and sanctifieth
it.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O Ministers withhold not our Pensions, but
incline our hearts to keep this law.</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> Honour the Regent and Lord Castlereagh,
that thy seat may be long in the Parliament, which the
Boroughmonger hath sold to thee.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O Ministers bestow your gifts upon us, and
incline our hearts to keep this law.</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> Thou shalt not say that a <span class="sc">Prince</span>, or a <span class="sc">Duke</span>
hath committed <span class="sc">Murder</span>.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O ye <span class="sc">Princes</span> and <span class="sc">Dukes</span> be gracious unto us,
and incline our hearts to set aside the law.</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> Thou shalt not say the <span class="sc">Prince</span> committeth
adultery.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O Prince be gracious unto us, and incline our
hearts to pervert the law.</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> Thou shalt not hesitate to procure false witnesses
against those whom we fear.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O Ministers be mindful of us, and incline our
hearts to keep this law.</p>

<p><cite>Minister.</cite> Thou shalt not covet the company of Reformers,
nor be found with them, nor consent to any of their
ways, nor be with their wives or servants, or any thing that
is theirs.</p>

<p><cite>Host.</cite> O Minister by the continuance of our Places, our
Pensions, and our Sinecures, write all these thy laws in our
hearts we beseech thee.</p>

<p><abbr title="paragraph marker">¶</abbr> <i>Then shall follow the Collect for the Ministry belonging
to the House of Lords.</i></p>

<p><i>Let us Pray.</i> Mighty Prince whose kingdom may not be
lasting; whose power is finite; Have mercy upon the
whole Host; and be so ruled by thy chosen servants, Liverpool,
Sidmouth, Eldon, and their associates, that they
(knowing whose Ministers they are) may above all things
aggrandize themselves and dependents; and that we (duly
considering under whose authority we are) may faithfully
serve, honour, and humbly obey them, in view of, and
hoping for farther benefits, according to thy word and
ordinance; through Castlereagh our Chief. Amen.</p>

<p><abbr title="paragraph marker">¶</abbr> <i>A Collect for those of the Ministry of the House of
Commons.</i></p>

<p>Mighty and lasting Prince, we are taught by thy conduct
that the hearts of Princes are at the disposal of their
Ministers, and that thou dost dispose and turn thine as it
seemeth best to their goodly wisdom: We humbly beseech
thee so to continue thy condescension to Castlereagh, Vansittart,
and their associates, that in all their thoughts, words
and actions, they may ever seek their own honour and glory,
and study to preserve us committed to their charge, in
wealth, peace and goodliness: through Castlereagh our
Chief. Amen.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Creed for the use of Corruption’s Host.</i></p>

<p>I believe in Lord Castlereagh, the supreme director of all
our affairs, maker of treaties for all nations, for the benefit
of none; and in the excellence of his features, fundamental
and unfundamental.</p>

<p>And in one George Canning, of doubtful origin, the tool
and puppet of Lord Castlereagh, who, together with Lord
Castlereagh, falling out about their share of the public
plunder, went into a certain field to fight with swords and
pistols, unfortunately without any intent to kill, who came
out again without injury, to the great grief of all the People;
who went on an embassy to the Court of Portugal, where
there was no King, for the sole purpose of recovering the
health of his son, at the expence of many thousands of
pounds to the People: he rose again to the Cabinet, from
whence he judgeth the Reformers; and his impudence
shall have no end.</p>

<p>And I believe in the Prince Regent, Lord and Giver of
Places, who, together with the Ministers, we should worship
and glorify, who speaketh by Proclamations, Commissioners,
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
and Green Bags; I believe in the stability of the funds, I
look not for a remission of taxes, no, not till the Resurrection
of the Dead. And I look not for a better Government
in the world to come. Amen.</p>

<p>This is an amplified re-issue of the preceding work, with
notes, and repeating the genealogical table so as to include
the name of George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> This edition of <cite>The Chronicles of
the Kings</cite> should have a large folding perspective chronology
of the Reign of George the Third, which is frequently
wanting.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from this work, describing
the reigns of Elizabeth and James:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Now Elizabeth was twenty and five years old when she
began to reign, and she reigned over England forty and four
years, four months, and seven days, and her mother’s name
was Anna Bullen. And she choose unto herself wise and
able ministers, and governed her kingdom with power and
great glory.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The sea also was subject unto her, and she reigned on
the ocean with a mighty hand.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Her admirals compassed the world about, and brought
her home treasures from the uttermost parts of the earth.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The glory of England she advanced to its height, and
all the princes of the earth sought her love; her love was
fixed on the happiness of her people, and would not be
divided. The era of learning was also in her reign, and the
genius of wit shone bright in the land. Spencer and Shakespeare,
Verulam and Sidney, Raleigh and Drake adorned
the court, and made her reign immortal. And woe unto you
Spaniards, woe unto you, you haughty usurpers of the
American seas for at the light’ning of her eyes ye were
destroyed, and at the breath of her mouth ye were scattered
abroad; she came unto your armada as a whirlwind, and as
a tempest of thunder she overwhelmed you in the sea.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Wisdom and strength were in her right hand, and in
her left were glory and wealth.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“She spake, and it was war; she waved her hand, and
the nations dwelt in peace.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Her Ministers were just, and her counsellers were sage;
her captains were bold, and her maids of honour ate beefsteaks
for their breakfast.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“And Elizabeth slept with her fathers, and she was a
virgin. She was buried in the chapel of King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>,
and James of Scotland reigned in her stead.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“And Jamie thought himself a bonny King, and a
mickle wise mon, howbeit, he was a fool and a pedant.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“But the spirit of flattery went forth in the land, and the
great men and the bishops offered incense unto him, saying,
O most sacred King! thou art wiser than the children of
men; thou speakest by the spirit of God; there has been
none equal to thee before thee; neither will any rise after
thee like unto thee.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Thus they abused him daily with lying and fulsome
adulation; and the ear of James was tickled therewith,
and he was puffed up and thought himself wise; whereupon
he began to dispute with the doctors, and to decide controversies,
and to write books, and the world was undeceived.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">An Election Placard.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>In favour of Charles James Fox, Westminster, 1784.</i></p>

<p class="center">The first Chapter of the Times.</p>

<p>1. And it came to pass that there were great dissensions
in the West, amongst the rulers of the Nation.</p>

<p>2. And the counsellors of the back stairs said, Let us take
advantage and yoke the people even as oxen, and rule them
with a rod of iron.</p>

<p>3. And let us break up the Assembly of Privileges, and
get a new one of Prerogatives; and let us hire false prophets
to deceive the people. And they did so.</p>

<p>4. Then Judas Iscariot went among the citizens, saying,
“Choose me one of your Elders, and I will tax your
innocent damsels, and I will take the bread from the
helpless, lame and blind.</p>

<p>5. “And with the scrip which will arise, we will eat,
drink, and be merry.”</p>

<p>Then he brought forth the roll of sheepskin, and came
unto the ginshops, cellars, and bye places, and said, “Sign
your names,” and many made their marks.</p>

<p>6. Now it came to pass, that the time being come when
the people choose their elders, that they assembled together
at the hustings, nigh unto the Place of Cabbages.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_348" id="fnanchor_348"></a><a href="#footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>7. And Judas<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_349" id="fnanchor_349"></a><a href="#footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></span> lifted up his prerogative phiz, and
said “Choose me, choose me.” But the people said,
“Satan, avaunt! thou wicked Judas! hast thou not <em>deceived</em>
thy best friend? Would’st thou <em>deceive</em> us also? Get thee
behind us, thou unclean Spirit!”</p>

<p>8. We will have the man who ever has and will support
our cause, and maintain our rights, who stands forth to us,
and who will never be guided by <em>Secret Influence</em>!</p>

<p><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
9. And the people shouted, and cried with an exceeding
loud voice, saying “Fox is the man!”</p>

<p>10. Then they caused the trumpets to be sounded, as at
the feast of the full moon, and sang, “Long live Fox, may
our champion live for ever! Amen!”</p>

<p><cite>In Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</cite> for October, 1817,
there appeared an article entitled “Translation of an
ancient Chaldee Manuscript,” it commenced on page 89,
and ended at the foot of page 96. It was written in Biblical
phraseology and was divided into four chapters, each
of which was subdivided into verses. The parody was made
on a certain chapter of Ezekiel, and was introduced by a
preface, stating that it was a translation of a Chaldee manuscript
preserved in a great library at Paris.</p>

<p>Professor Ferrier, in a Notice appended to Christopher
North’s <cite>Nodes Ambrosianae</cite>, says “this trenchant satire
on men and things in the metropolis of Scotland, excited
the most indescribable commotion at the time&mdash;so much
noise, indeed, that never since has it been permitted to
make any noise whatever, having been pitilessly suppressed
in consequence of threatened legal proceedings.” But some
prosecutions were nevertheless commenced, and one was referred
to the private decision of a Scotch judge, who, it is
said, convicted the Publisher, and fined him two hundred
and thirty pounds, for a foul and indecent libel.</p>

<p>The November number, 1817, of <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite>
contained the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Note from the Editor.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Editor has learned with regret, that an article in the
First Edition of last Number, which was intended merely as
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i>, has been construed so as to give offence to
individuals justly entitled to respect and regard; he has on
that account withdrawn it in the Second Edition, and can
only add, that if what has happened could have been anticipated,
the article in question certainly never would have
appeared.</p>

<p class="blockquote">With the December Number will be given eight pages,
to supply the deficiency occasioned by the omission of the
article, <cite>Translation from an Ancient Chaldee Manuscript</cite>.”</p>

<p>It has been recently ascertained that the original conception
of this Chaldee M.S. was due to James Hogg,
who wrote part of it, the remainder of the production
being the work of Christopher North, and Lockhart.</p>

<p>A set of the magazine containing this parody is now
rarely to be met with.</p>

<p>Professor Ferrier considers that people of the present
day would be greatly amused by what he calls this delicious
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i>. Perhaps a few Scotchmen intimately
acquainted with the Edinburgh literature and society of
seventy years ago might be, but to the majority of readers
the <cite>Chaldee Manuscript</cite> would appear dull, tedious, and
uninteresting, otherwise it would have been inserted in
this chapter.</p>

<p>In the works of Father Prout (Rev. Francis Mahony)
the following passage occurs with reference to the Comte
de Buffon:&mdash;“Having predetermined not to leave Moses
a leg to stand on, he sweeps away at one stroke of his pen
the foundations of Genesis, and reconstructs this terraqueous
planet on a new patent principle. I have been at
some pains to acquire a comprehensive notion of his
system, and aided by an old Jesuit, I have succeeded in
condensing the voluminous dissertation into, a few lines,
for the use of those who are dissatisfied with the Mosaic
statement, particularly the professors at the school in
Gower Street:&mdash;”</p>

<p>1. In the beginning was the sun, from which a splinter
was shot off by chance, and that fragment was our globe.</p>

<p>2. And the globe had for its nucleus melted glass,
with an envelope of hot water.</p>

<p>3. And it begun to twirl round, and became somewhat
flattened at the poles.</p>

<p>4. Now, when the water grew cool, insects began to
appear, and shell-fish.</p>

<p>5. And from the accumulation of shells, particularly
oysters (tom. i. 4to. edit. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 14), the earth was gradually
formed, with ridges of mountains, on the principle of the
Monte Testacio at the gate of Rome.</p>

<p>6. But the melted glass kept warm for a long time,
and the arctic climate was as hot in those days as the

<p class="p2 center ls">THE BIBLE OF THE FUTURE.</p>

<p>The following specimen of what is to be the Bible of
the future is published by an American <span class="lock">paper:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Genesis.</span>&mdash;Chapter 1.</p>

<p>1. Primarily the Unknowable moved upon cosmos, and
evolved protoplasm.</p>

<p>2. And protoplasm was inorganic and undifferentiated,
containing all things in potential energy; and a spirit of
evolution moved upon the fluid mass.</p>

<p>3. And the Unknowable said, Let atoms attract; and
their contact begat light, heat, and electricity.</p>

<p>4. And the Unconditioned differentiated the atoms,
each after its kind; and their combinations begat rock,
air, and water.</p>

<p>5. And there went out a spirit of evolution from the
Unconditioned, and working in protoplasm, by accretion
and absorption, produced the organic cell.</p>

<p>6. And cell by nutrition evolved primordial germ, and
germ developed protogene, and protegene begat eozoon,
and eozoon begat monad, and monad begat animalcule.</p>

<p>7. And animalcule begat ephemera; then began
creeping things to multiply on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>8. And earthy atom in vegetable protoplasm begat the
molecule, and thence came all grass, and every herb in
the earth.</p>

<p>9. And animacule in the water evolved fins, tails,
claws, and scales; and in the air wings and beaks; and
on the land they sprouted such organs as were necessary
as played upon by the environment.</p>

<p>10. And by accretion and absorption came the radiata
and mollusca; and mollusca begat articulata, and
articulata begat vertebrata.</p>

<p>11. Now these are the generations of the higher
vertebrata, in the cosmic period that the Unknowable
evoluted the bipedal mammalia.</p>

<p>12. And every man of the earth, while he was yet a
monkey, and the horse while he was an hipparian, and
the hipparian before he was an oredon.</p>

<p>13. Out of the ascidian came the amphibian, and begat
the pentadactyle; and the pentadactyle, by inheritance
and selection, produced the hylobate, from which are the
simiadæ in all their tribes.</p>

<p>14. And out of the simiadæ the lemur prevailed above
his fellows, and produced the platyrhine monkey.</p>

<p>15. And the platyrhine begat the catarrhine, and the
catarrhine monkey begat the anthropoid ape, and the
ape begat the longimanous orang, and the orang begat
the chimpanzee, and the chimpanzee evoluted the
what-is-it.</p>

<p>16. And the what-is-it went into the land of Nod, and
took him a wife of the longimanus gibbons.</p>

<p>17. And in process of the cosmic period were born
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
unto them and their children the anthropomorphic
primordial types.</p>

<p>18. The homunculus, the prognathus, the troglodyte,
the autochthon, the terragene&mdash;these are the generations
of primeval man.</p>

<p>19. And primeval man was naked and not ashamed,
but lived in quadrumanous innocence, and struggled
mightily to harmonise with the environment.</p>

<p>20. And by inheritance and natural selection did he
progress from the stable and homogeneous to the complex
and heterogeneous&mdash;for the weakest died, and the
strongest grew and multiplied.</p>

<p>21. And man grew a thumb for that he had need of it,
and developed capacities for prey.</p>

<p>22. For, behold, the swiftest men caught the most
animals, and the swiftest animals got away from the
most men: wherefore the slow animals were eaten and
the slow men starved to death.</p>

<p>23. And as types were differentiated the weaker types
continually disappeared.</p>

<p>24. And the earth was filled with violence; for man
strove with man, and tribe with tribe, whereby they
killed off the weak and foolish, and secured the survival
of the fittest.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">An American View of Bicycling.</span></p>

<p>“And in these days the young man of the city is possessed
of a demon, and he taketh it upon him to learn to
ride the bicycle. And he goeth unto them that teach the
instrument; and he sayeth unto them, Lo, now, teach me
this thing, at one half a trade shekel the hour. And they
make answer and say unto him, Behold now; here is the
machine; and here art thou. Get on it, therefore and
ride; for all things are possible to him that hath nerve.</p>

<p>And he taggeth after that machine for the next six
weeks; yea, even until both his knees are like unto works
of decorative art for colourful picturesqueness; and he
frescoeth his entire person in black and blue, and he
smasheth the machine variously and expensively; and in
the fulness of time he learneth to mount and ride, and
becometh an alleged proficient in the art.</p>

<p>And then, being puffed up with vanity, and being made
mad with an injudicious ambition, he saith unto himself:
Lo, now, I will try this thing upon the road. And he getteth
permission to pay the hire of a machine, and to take the
same up the avenue which is called fifth, to the northward
of the hill which is called the Hill of Nobs; because
of the exceedingly great number of nobs which dwell
thereabouts.</p>

<p>And being mounted, he passeth out of the gates of the
city, and journeyeth towards the suburbs, being at times
in the saddle, and at other times for variety’s sake (which
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
is, as was spoken by the prophets, as a spice unto life),
upon his head.</p>

<p>And it shall come to pass that he meeteth casual
maidens, who shall smile upon him, and make glad his
heart within him. And, for that man is foolish and mankind
is indiscreet, he shall put on the frills of vanity, and
ride in the curves of conceit, and take no heed.</p>

<p>And in the end there shall come that way a school of
young maidens, who shall say each one unto the other:
Behold him upon the bicycle; and behold the young man
upon two wheels. Is he not comely; and is he not fair
to see among the young men of Israel? And moreover
shall it come to pass that the young man shall be tempted
of the evil one, and shall undertake to turn on the outer
edge, and to put his legs over the handle, and shall
generally be so previous and preliminary that presently
the young students of Bellevue Hospital shall cobble him
after their own will and fashion.</p>

<p>And when he shall have recovered as much as he ever
shall, that young man will give his bycycle unto his
bitterest enemy, whom he hateth with a hate unspeakable,
saying: Let this be for a peace-offering from me to
thee; and let there be no more strife between us.</p>

<p>For is there not peace in the grave; and shall war be
waged against them that are utterly smashed up.”</p>

<p>The author of a book entitled “Usury and the English
Bishops” (by R. G. Sillar, with an introduction by Professor
Ruskin. A. Southey, 146, Fenchurch-street, London), dedicates
it, “without permission,” to the Bishops of Manchester,
Peterborough, and Rochester. Mr. Ruskin, in an introduction,
endorses in the following language the opinions <span class="lock">expressed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I rejoice to see my old friend Mr. Sillar gathering finally
together the evidence he has so industriously collected on the
guilt of Usury, and supporting it by the always impressive
language of symbolical art; for indeed I had myself no idea,
till I read the connected statement which these pictures
illustrate, how steadily the system of money-lending had
gained on the nation, and how fatally every hand and foot
was now entangled by it.</p>

<p>“I place,” says Mr. Ruskin, “side by side the ancient and
modern versions of the seven verses of the New Testament
which were the beginning, and are indeed the heads, of all

<p>In <cite>The Spirit of the Public Journals for 1809</cite> (<abbr title="Volume Thirteen">Vol.
XIII.</abbr>, London, J. Ridgway), there is a scriptural imitation,
styled <cite>A Tale of other Times</cite>. This originally appeared in
the “Morning Post.” It was an endeavour to apologise
for the conduct of the Duke of York, who had been compelled,
by public opinion, to resign the office of Commander-in-Chief,
owing to the exposure of a wholesale traffic in
army commissions, carried on by his mistress, Mrs. Clarke.
The parody represents the Duke as more of a fool than a
knave; it has, however, never yet been settled whether
folly or knavery preponderated in his disposition. These
qualities appear to have been pretty equally balanced, and
this parody does not decide the question.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> 16 of the same collection, for 1812, there is an

<p>Jocularity in the pulpit has been often reproved as unseemly,
yet it is still largely indulged in by a certain class
of ministers. <cite>Punch in the Pulpit</cite>, by Philip Cater (London:
W. Freeman, 1863), gives some amusing examples of
this curious kind of devotion.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_108"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 108</a> a burlesque sermon founded on the Nursery
Rhyme of <cite>Old Mother Hubbard</cite> was given, a similar production
is sold by a printer named Tresize, in Beech Street,
Barbican. It is styled <cite>A Yankee Sermon</cite>, and is founded on
the text “For they shall knaw a file, and flee unto the
mountains of Hepsidam, whar the lion roareth, and the
wang-foodle mourneth for his first born.”</p>

<p>During his trials, Mr. Hone made several references to
the following song, as showing that reverend and serious
writers could jest about religious topics, without any intention
to be profane. It was taken from the Reverend Mark
Noble’s continuation of the Rev. Mr. Granger’s <cite>Biographical
History of England</cite>, and showed that it was never apprehended
by the most pious men, that a casual association
of ludicrous images with matters of the Christian religion
tended to weaken the respect due to that faith. Mr. Noble,
in his work, quoted this song respecting Dr. Burnett, the
author of <cite>The Theory of the Earth</cite>, and Master of the
Charter-<span class="lock">House:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>Of purely Political parodies the number is
so great, that any attempt at printing a
complete collection is out of the question. At
the most, mention can only be made, and
brief extracts given from a few of the best
examples. The King’s (or Queen’s) speeches
to Parliament, on the opening and closing
days, have been the subject of parodies for
very many years.</p>

<p>One of the earliest, and certainly the most
famous of these was an anonymous pamphlet
published in 1778, entitled “<cite>Anticipation</cite>:
Containing the substance of His Majesty’s
Most Gracious Speech to both Houses of
Parliament on the Opening of the approaching
Session, together with a full and
authentic account of the Debate which <em>will</em>
take place in the House of Commons, on
the motion for the <cite>Address</cite>, and the <cite>Amendment</cite>,
with Notes.” (First published three Days
before the Opening of the Session.) London:
T. Beckett, 1778.</p>

<p>The address and the Debate occupy 74
pages octavo, and were no doubt highly
entertaining at the time, as the characteristics
and oddities of the various speakers who were
satirised were then familiar, but have long
since been forgotten.</p>

<p>The principal topic in the debate was the
unfavourable issue of the War with the United
States of America.</p>

<p>This clever pamphlet (which ran through
several editions) was written by Richard
Tickell, who died in 1793.</p>

<p>Coming to more modern times <cite>Figaro in
London</cite>, a satirical paper which flourished in
the “thirties,” had numerous parodies of
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
Parliamentary Speeches, making fun of
William <abbr title="Four">IV</abbr>, his wife, and his Ministers. These
were generally illustrated by Seymour, who
delighted to represent William as a silly old
man, with a silly old face, and his wife as a
scraggy virago, keeping the King very much
under control.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The King’s Speech.</span></p>

<p>The annual period of humbug is at length come round
again, and the time has arrived for the King to put his name
to the rubbish which is drawn up for him by his Ministers.</p>

<p>Of course, we are, so far as any public sources of information
are concerned, wholly ignorant of the subject of this
precious bit of ministerial eloquence that is to close the first
Session of our first Reformed Parliament, but our private
channels are so numerous, that it is impossible for the
Government to prevent the secrets of the Cabinet from
coming into the cognizance of <cite>Figaro</cite>.</p>

<p>The following is a slight sketch of the document alluded
<span class="lock">to:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="indent5"><i>My Lords and Gentlemen</i>,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I have to thank you for the very able manner in which
you have contrived to humbug my people for the last seven
months. I hope you will act in the same consistent manner
next Session, for the dignity of your Lordship’s house, the
protection of the Constitution, and the welfare of Great
Britain.</p>

<p class="indent5"><i>Gentlemen of the House of Commons</i>,</p>

<p class="blockquote">You have my most sincere thanks for the singular tact
with which you have contrived to debate every night till a
late hour, and have yet managed to do nothing at all but
pass the Coercive Bill for Ireland.</p>

<p class="blockquote">By a continuance in the same course, you will, I am sure,
contribute to the stability of my Ministry, and to filling the
Parliamentary columns of the newspapers.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I cannot help expressing my admiration of the wonderful
talent you have displayed in sitting under the name of a Reformed
Parliament, and yet acting precisely in the same spirit
as all preceding ones.</p>

<p class="indent5"><i>My Lords and Gentlemen of the House of Commons.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote">I am very happy to say, that my foreign relations are all
as eager as ever to keep up the profession without the practice
of liberality; and that Pedro is likely to be as great a
scoundrel as his brother Miguel.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I hope, my Lords and Gentlemen, that when you meet next
session, you will be as talkative as you have been during that
which has just come to a close; and, that you will not think
of business till my faithful ministers have a plea for saying it
is too late to do any.</p>

<p class="blockquote">As for the supplies, I thank you for them, from the bottom
of my heart, for I accept them as a strong mark of your
attachment and loyalty.</p>

<p class="blockquote">My good people call for retrenchment, and I trust you will
give your attention to the underlings of all offices, as you
have done before, for a person who has little is better
qualified to do without anything, than one who has been
accustomed to a superfluity.</p>

<p class="blockquote">I am convinced your sense of honour will teach you to
respect the great receivers of the public pay, while the little
ones, being more numerous, will afford a wider display for
and more room for the practise of your retrenching abilities.”</p>

<p><cite>Figaro in London.</cite> August 31, 1833.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen’s Speech.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Disraeli’s valet having abstracted from his
master’s pocket a rough copy of the Royal Speech, transmitted
it to us, we hasten to present the document to our
readers.</p>

<p class="indent5"><span class="sc">My Lords and Gentlemen</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The session now terminated, although not productive
of any very striking measures, save that of creating me an
Empress, has, nevertheless, proved highly advantageous
to the country. My Government has been much occupied
with undoing those acts of their predecessors which
were considered as essentially beneficial to my subjects.
I trust that these efforts will tend, under Providence, to
the maintenance of the Tories in office, and to my own
and my children’s benefit.</p>

<p class="blockquote">We must all deeply regret that civil war has broken out
in the empire of my old and attached ally, the Turk. It
appears he has been compelled to bayonet a number of
babies, violate numerous maidens, and outrage a multitude
of married women. But as my Prime Minister
assures me these are the ordinary occurrences of civil
warfare, we need trouble ourselves no further on the
subject.</p>

<p class="blockquote">My trusty cousin the Duke of Cambridge having,
through instituting the late military manœuvres for the
mobilization of my army, revealed to the nation his own
utter imbecility and that of the department over which
he presides, I have thought fit to recognise such distinguished
services by bestowing on him the colonelcy of the
17th Lancers, worth £1,300 per annum.</p>

<p class="blockquote">As the march of my third son, the Duke of Connaught,
from Liverpool to Edinburgh, is universally recognised
as one of the greatest military achievements of the age,
and surrounded with danger, the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury will prepare a special form of thanksgiving
to Providence for the happy issue of this stupendous
exploit.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The navy is conspicuous, as heretofore, for its thorough
efficiency. My relative, the Prince of Leiningen, has not
yet had an opportunity of distinguishing himself on the
Solent, but, doubtless, before the season closes, he will
again display that nautical skill for which he has rendered
himself so famous. My second son Alfred, has been appointed
to the Sultan, which ship has hitherto been
quietly at anchor in Besika Bay. Should the opportunity
present itself, I feel assured that he will duly qualify himself
for the post of Lord High Admiral by running the
Sultan ashore,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_350" id="fnanchor_350"></a><a href="#footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></span> sinking a consort, or some equally meritorious
service. My First Lord of the Admiralty has,
however, fully maintained the great credit he obtained
for his management of the navy, through the destruction
of the Vanguard and the Mistletoe, by the recent explosion
on board the Thunderer, and the slaughter of forty
men; thus, at one and the same time, giving an impetus
to the engineering and undertaking trades, and proving,
beyond question, the perfect ability of my navy&mdash;to
destroy itself.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="pageno">31</span>
The financial condition of the country is, I rejoice to
state, in most respects satisfactory. You have managed
to increase the national income by imposing two millions
of taxation on my subjects, doubtless a very proper proceeding;
but, at the same time, I must remind you that
mine has not been increased. I am, moreover, gratified
in being able to announce that owing to Sir Bartle
Frere’s economical management of the grant allowed to
my eldest son for the purposes of his religious mission to
India, a threepenny-piece out of the sum will be returned
to the Treasury. Many distinguished foreigners have
come to England of late, and after having been entertained
at their own expense, and visited the Mausoleum, doubtless
left the country duly impressed with the magnificent
hospitality of its Court.</p>

<p class="blockquote">My lords and gentlemen, in dismissing you to the
pleasures of grouse shooting, after a laborious session,
which, in the course of five months has managed to undo
much of the good that it took years to effect, I trust
that Providence will further your future efforts in the
same praiseworthy direction.”</p>

<p>An answer to the Proclamation calling out

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Punch’s Proclamation.</span></p>

<p class="center">PUNCHIUS, R.</p>

<p>Whereas, by the Reserve (Moral) Force Acts of no
particular date, but of general recognition and universal
application, it is, amongst other things, provided that, in
case of imminent national danger and emergency, the
Reserve Forces of Prudence, Patience, Patriotism, Justice,
Magnanimity, Wise Forethought, and Rational Self-Restraint,
ordinarily latent in the breasts of the sober,
sagacious, and, for the most part, silent portion of the
community, may authoritatively be called out on active
public service.</p>

<p>And whereas the present state of public affairs and
public opinion, and the necessity in connection therewith
of taking steps for the maintenance of peace, and for the
protection of real interests, honour, and fair fame of the
Empire, and, especially, of checking the insurgent forces of
Pride, Passion, Prejudice, and spurious (if well-intended)
Patriotism, now and for some time past deplorably and
mischievously rampant, in our opinion, constitute a case of
great emergency within the meaning of the said Acts:</p>

<p>Now, therefore, We do, in pursuance of the said Acts
and of our earnest endeavour for the furtherance of the
Public Weal, hereby direct that forthwith all classes of the
Reserve Forces above specified be called out on permanent
service, and shall henceforth proceed to and attend in their
places (in Parliament or otherwise), and at such time or
times as may be needful, to serve as part of Our Army of
Moral Militancy until their services are no longer required.</p>

April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred

Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, we meet of course only to exchange the most

and not representing anybody or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;: Quite so. Exactly.</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash;: But there is one thing that I may say
officially and with authority. In my capacity as Viceroy
of Ireland, and speaking with the sanction of the whole
Cabinet on this particular subject, a subject on which I
may say we are absolutely unanimous, I have to state
that I do think the weather so far is disappointing and
disagreeable.</p>

<p>Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, solemnly: Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, I have no hesitation
in saying, not only on my own behalf, but on that of the
whole Irish Parliamentary party, and of the Irish people
as well, that we, too, find the weather disappointing and
disagreeable.</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash;: That’s all right. But now, Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;,
coming to unimportant matters, and speaking together as
men absolutely free from any manner of responsibility,
and, indeed, having no particular motive of any kind but
that of whiling away a few minutes in pleasant gossip, do
you think it would be a good thing if we&mdash;the Conservatives&mdash;were
to introduce a Home Rule measure for
Ireland?</p>

<p>Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;: Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, I am now speaking entirely as
a private, and I may say an isolated individual, having no
knowledge of the views of any of my colleagues, and,
indeed, assuming that they would be rather opposed to
me than not in most things, and thus free from all
responsibility, I venture to say that I, for myself, should
not be displeased if you were to introduce a Home Rule
measure for Ireland.</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash;: Thanks; then again I should like to ask
you, merely to gratify the idlest personal curiosity, and
not having consulted or intending ever to consult any
human being on the subject, whether you think that if
I were to promise&mdash;just for the fun of the thing you
know&mdash;to get such a measure introduced, you could
promise&mdash;also of course for the mere fun of the thing&mdash;to
give us your support at the coming elections?</p>

<p>Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;: Well, of course, regarding the whole thing
as a mere light-hearted piece of pleasantry, between two
men notorious for their vivacity and levity, and neither of
whom could be supposed to have any serious purpose of
any kind, I may say perhaps that in such a case I could
promise, just for the fun of the thing&mdash;as you happily put
it&mdash;I could promise you some support at the coming
elections.</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash;: Thanks very much. Now coming to
serious subjects.&mdash;May I ask you Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; whether you,
speaking officially as leader of the Irish people, are
prepared to agree in an opinion which I have the
authority of the whole Cabinet for expressing, that the
present season in London is likely to be short and
unsatisfactory?</p>

<p>Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;: On such a question as this I speak with
a profound sense of responsibility; but I have no hesitation
in saying, as leader of the Irish Parliamentary party,
on behalf of that party and of the whole people of
Ireland, and likewise on behalf of the Irish Populations of
America, Australia, Brazil, and Patagonia, that Ireland’s
conviction is that the present season in London will be
short and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Political Manifestoes.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Mr. Chamberlain’s Address.</i></p>

<p>Gentlemen.&mdash;The new Parliament is about to be dissolved
under circumstances unparalleled in the history of this
country. I am alive, and not one of the bosses of the show.
At the 1885 election, Mr. Gladstone, extending his usual
method, indicated four subjects of primary importance.
Need I add that one of these, <em>the</em> one, was myself? Under
these circumstances, it does not appear to have entered into
the mind of any Liberal candidate that within a few weeks
he would be invited to consider a vast revolution in the relations
between me and the G. O. M.</p>

<p>The 1885 election was fought on the programme formulated
by Mr. Gladstone, subject to my approval, and on
collateral issues of purely domestic interest. Now, as I am
only capable of understanding domestic and vestry matters,
it will be readily understood that I disapprove of any dealing
with large and statesmanlike questions beyond my
comprehension. What the Liberal party in last November
solemnly and seriously declared to be unsafe, the Prime
Minister, egged on I do not doubt by that accursed Morley,
has now deliberately undertaken. The authority of the
Prime Minister has been sufficient to work this startling
transformation, and mine, alas! <a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>insufficient to prevent it.
The Irish Government Bill (<i>i.e.</i>, Mr. Gladstone) would repeal
the act of union between me and the G.O.M. It would
also set up a rival Parliament in Dublin; and&mdash;you may
believe one who has suffered much from a rival
politician in London&mdash;this will be most unpleasant.</p>

<p>To desert me for Morley&mdash;me, whose only crime in the
G.O.M.’s eyes is the peddling and board-of-guardians’ spirit
in which I approach all questions&mdash;is an act of ingratitude
and cowardice unworthy only of the Caucus.</p>

<p>So anxious am I, not particularly to stop Home Rule, but
most particularly to teach the G.O.M. a severe lesson for
preferring Morley to me, that I say nothing for the moment
even against those landlords, my customary mark, who hold
their land by exactly the same means and right as I hold
my capital. Nor am I, under the circumstances, disinclined
to coercion.</p>

<p>No one has recognised more strongly than myself the
claims of party and the duty incumbent on all to sacrifice
individual preferences to the necessity of united action, when
it suits them. But I am so real riled at the way the G.O.M.
and Morley have treated me that, in spite of all my ill-temper
and mischief-making, I hope to retain the support,
though I have lost the confidence, of those whose interests I
have loyally endeavoured to serve, as long as they did not
conflict with my own, and in whose midst my life as a
capitalist has been spent, and my work of screw and caucus-making
accomplished.</p>

<p>Colonel Saunderson, M.P., had asserted at a public
meeting that, if Parliament should grant Home Rule to

<p>For many years past Mr. Gladstone has been the “leading

Parodists. His personal appearance, his collars, his umbrella,
his hobby for felling trees, his great learning, his immense

<p class="center sc lowercase">ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS.</p>

<p>During the past twenty years, and indeed ever since it
became generally known that Mr. Gladstone was in the
habit of wielding an axe, a steady flow of letters has ceaselessly
poured into Hawarden Castle from all parts of the
world, asking for chips and blocks of wood cut from the
timber felled by the right honourable gentleman.</p>

<p>At first these demands were complied with so far as it was
possible to do so, but as the Irish Question surged to the
front, and Mr. Gladstone’s popularity with the civilised
world increased, it became hopeless to deal with the applications,
which have accumulated to such an extent that the
paper on which the applications are written has been weighed
out of curiosity, and is found to weigh 4 tons 17 cwt. 3 qrs.
17 lbs.</p>

<p>Some fortnight or so ago Mr. Gladstone announced
through the press that in future, blocks from timber cut
down by his hand would only be supplied on receipt of a
postal order for three shillings.</p>

<p>He did this in the hope that it would deter his numerous
correspondents, instead of which they have increased twenty-fold.
Under the circumstances, it occurred to Mr. Gladstone
that by the erection of large and commodious saw
mills the demand might be dealt with and a lucrative industry
started without any very large outlay.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, whose great name is the sole origin of the
business, and who is henceforward, called the vendor, can cut
down three medium-sized trees per diem. These trees will
yield an average of 7,000 blocks, which, sold at 3s., means a
daily sale of</p>

<p>It is perfectly obvious that the public demand is so great
that the entire estate can be disafforested at an enormous
profit, the price of three shillings per cubic foot block being
as nearly as possible 30 times the normal value of the
timber.</p>

As the only drawback to the success of the undertaking
is the illness, or, it may be, possible demise of the vendor,
his life will be insured as a first preliminary for £100,000,
being the entire capital of the company.</p>

<p>It is not anticipated that it will be necessary to call up
more than the allotment money, as it is calculated when the
premium has been paid on the vendor’s life, and the stipulated
price for the goodwill (£25,000) has been handed over
to the vendor, there will still remain sufficient in hand to
erect the necessary saw mills and machinery.</p>

<p>The following contract has been entered into: An agreement
dated the 23rd day of October, 1887, and made between
William Ewart Gladstone of the one part, and
Archibald Philip Primrose, Earl of Rosebery, on behalf of
the company, of the other part.</p>

<p>Copies of the agreement of purchase, valuers’ certificates,
and memorandum and articles of association may be inspected
at the offices of the company, or of the bankers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Scarcely a week passes but what Mr. Gladstone appears
as the central figure in <cite>Judy’s</cite> political cartoon; <cite>Judy</cite>
has also published (separately) some burlesque Company
prospectuses, one in 1885 was entitled “<span class="sc">W. E. Gladstone</span>
&amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr>, Limited,” with a capital of One Million
in £10 Shares. The proposed Directorate included the
following names: The Rt. Hon. W. E. G. <em>Chairman</em>.
Mr. H. Childish. Sir Veneer Half-caste. The Earl
Gumboil. The Earl Drowsy. Marquis of Heart-in-Mouth.
Joseph Chimneypot, Esq. (of the Birmingham Affidavit
Manufacturing Company), and Sir. C. Bilke.</p>

<p>A long list was given of the objects to be achieved by the
Company, all of which were represented as being nefarious
and unpatriotic, such being the usual and natural assertion of
each political party with regard to the actions of the other.</p>

<p>Another publication issued from the <cite>Judy</cite> office, dated
November 1, 1885, and sold for threepence, was a legal
looking paper, endorsed <cite>The Last Will and Testament of
William Ewart Gladstone</cite>. This was not a very witty production,
the most notable clauses it contains are those in
which Mr. Gladstone appoints Joseph Chamberlain and
Bottomley Firth as his executors; the bequest to Lord
Randolph Churchill “of twelve pence sterling to the end he
may therewith buy a rope of hemp and go hang himself;”
to the Sublime Porte of “a complete file of Newspapers
containing all my speeches on the Bulgarian Atrocities;”
and to Sir Charles Dilke “my Law treatise containing
chapters on Decrees Nisi.”</p>

<p>There are three Codicils to this will, all in very involved
and complicated language, and each one contradictory to the
others. This production had a large sale.</p>

<p>In October, 1879, <cite>The Examiner</cite> published an amusing
series of imaginary letters supposed to pass between the
leaders of both the great political parties, and their followers.
The following three are selected as <span class="lock">examples:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Lord Salisbury to Lord Beaconsfield.</span></p>

<p class="quotesig">Dieppe, Oct. 10.&emsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">My Dear Beaconsfield</span>,&mdash;I saw Waddington two days
ago. His bewilderment when I frankly told him that we
had no Greek policy would have been amusing, had it not
led to a long and troublesome remonstrance from him. It
appears that he thought we were in earnest at Berlin.
Of course I hastened to undeceive him, and to point out
that our only object at the Congress was to quiet the people
at home, and arrange with the Russians abroad. However,
I satisfied him at last by telling him he may do as he
pleases in Egypt.</p>

<p class="blockquote">By the way, I shall be speaking in a few days; I suppose
you have nothing to suggest. Grant Duff must be smashed,
and we must take what credit we can get out of Afghanistan.
But as Hartington is still, and Gladstone keeps out of the
way, I am afraid I shall have to tilt against egg-shells&mdash;for
Harcourt is nobody.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="quotesig"><span class="sc">Salisbury</span>.&emsp;</p>

<p class="blockquote">Have you heard of Derby’s latest move?</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Lord Beaconsfield to Lord Salisbury.</span></p>

<p class="quotesig">Hughenden Manor, Oct. 13.&emsp;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">My Dear Salisbury</span>,&mdash;Waddington does not quite
know us yet, or he would not have been surprised. If he
is satisfied, however, with our Egyptian plans, we will not
trouble any longer about him.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Your speech should be of great service. Harcourt may,
as you say, be dismissed very shortly&mdash;the impulsive imagination
of his immature intellect needs little comment from
you. Hartington is in a difficulty. The Home Rulers, on
one hand, and the Disestablishment section on the other,
are too many for him. Can you not hint at the various
nature of the forces he leads&mdash;aëronauts, somnambulists,
monomaniacs, misanthropes, and nomads? As for Gladstone,
it seems to me that he might be ferreted out. The
perennial perplexities of a pedagogic mind have driven him
once more to silence. Before he can present himself in
Midlothian, he must decide upon which conviction he will
follow. A word to that effect from you might reach him.</p>

<p class="blockquote">As for your audience, we trust to the generous judgment
of a judicial race. Leave the policy in that fashion. It
will flatter them.&mdash;Believe me, ever yours,</p>

<p class="quotesig"><span class="sc">Beaconsfield.</span>&emsp;</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Sir Stafford Northcote to Lord Beaconsfield.</span></p>

<p class="quotesig">Dublin, Oct. 12.&emsp;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">My Dear Lord Beaconsfield</span>,&mdash;I trust you will have
seen that I implicitly followed your instructions. I have
spoken for hours, and said absolutely nothing; received
scores of persons, and let them talk, too, without expressing
the slightest opinion; and the result is that I am most
popular. Their idea seemed to be that I was preparing
some scheme for the relief of distress, and as they were
pleased with that notion, I was of course careful not to
destroy it. On the whole, I have neither compromised the
Government nor myself, which is saying something.&mdash;Ever
yours,</p>

<p class="quotesig"><span class="sc">S. Northcote.&emsp;</span></p>

<p>This last letter refers to Irish affairs, which have given
rise to many political skits; one of the most important of
these was a pamphlet, published in 1886, by Reeves and
Turner, entitled “<cite>Opening and Proceedings of the Irish
Parliament</cite>. Two Visions.” The author, Mr. G. H.
Moore, thus describes the plan of his little work:&mdash;“In the
following pages you are presented with two forecasts of the
proceedings of the proposed Irish Parliament, taken from
different standpoints. They are intended to illustrate the
conflicting opinions entertained of the future, should Mr.
Gladstone’s Irish Bills pass into law.</p>

<p>The exaggerated fears and gloomy mistrust of the opponents
of the measures are ludicrously drawn in one picture;
and in the other, the serious hopes and the brighter anticipations
of the promoters and supporters of the measures are
assumed to have been realised.”</p>

<p>Articles based on the same idea, appeared in the <cite>Topical
Times</cite> in July 1886, entitled “The Dublin Parliament. A
Forecast,” describing the scenes of joy and enthusiasm in
the Irish capital on the first assembling of a National
Parliament.</p>
<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>

<p class="p2 center ls">THE OMNIBUS.</p>

<p>It is just sixty years ago since this convenient vehicle
was introduced into our streets by Mr. J. Shillibeer.
The first Omnibus ran from the Yorkshire Stingo in the
New Road, to the Bank of England, and the fare was
one shilling. The speculation succeeded at once, and the
omnibus traffic in London has been rapidly increasing
ever since. The following parody on Barry Cornwall’s
<cite>The Sea! The Sea!</cite> is taken from Mr. Hindley’s reprint
of Egan’s “Life in London.”</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_106">page 106</a> a splendid parody was given of “The House
that Jack Built,” entitled <cite>The Domicile Erected by John</cite>.
A correspondent pointed out that this was written by the
late Mr. E. L. Blanchard, and on consulting his famous
Drury-Lane Annuals, it was discovered as a preface to the
<a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Pantomime for 1861-62, styled “Harlequin and the House
that Jack built.” Mr. Blanchard’s poem is not quite so
long as the version given in <cite>Parodies</cite>, some ingenious
person having undertaken to add to, and improve upon Mr.
Blanchard’s work.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">LITERARY FORGERIES AND
IMPOSTURES.</p>

<p>Although literary forgeries have undoubtedly some relationship
with Parodies, it is of so distant a nature that, even
were space available, they could not be dealt with at any
length in this Collection. A brief summary of the principal
Impostures must therefore suffice, those who wish to learn
the details are referred to an interesting little work, entitled
<cite>Famous Literary Impostures</cite>, by H. R. Montgomery.
London. E. W. Allen. No date.</p>

<p>(<em>Why do Publishers omit dates?</em>)</p>

<p>Mr. Montgomery’s chapters deal with Thomas Chatterton
and the Rowley poems; James Macpherson’s Poems of
Ossian; Samuel W. H. Ireland’s Vortigern, and other
Shakespearian Forgeries; George Psalmanazar and the Formosa
Imposture; and the Bentley and Boyle controversy as
to the Epistles of Phalaris.</p>

<p>Of course had Mr. Montgomery chosen to enlarge his
work, he might have made some amusing chapters out of
William Lander’s attempt to prove Milton a plagiarist and
an impostor; of the Squire letters which deceived Thomas
Carlyle; the Shapira M.S.S. which deceived some clever
Egyptologists and Antiquarians; the Vrain-Lucas letters
which deceived M. Michel Chasles, an eminent French
Mathematician; the Shelley forgeries which deceived
Robert Browning; and the Donnelly cryptogram which
has deceived no one having any knowledge of the life and
works of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>In Isaac D’Israeli’s <cite>Curiosities of Literature</cite> there is a
short chapter on this topic, principally devoted to instances
amongst ancient and foreign writers, with a few remarks
about Psalmanazar and William Lander.</p>

<p>There is also some information to be found in a chapter,
called “Supposition d’Auteurs,” in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Curiosités Littéraires</cite>,
par Ludovic Lalanne. Paris, Adolphe Delahays, 1857. This
also deals principally with the works of foreign literary
Impostors. But by far the most important and most
reliable work on the subject is that written by the late M.
Octave Delepierre, entitled “<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Supercheries Littéraires</cite>,
Pastiches, Suppositions d’Auteur, dans les lettres et dans
les Arts.” London, N. Trubner &amp; <abbr title="Company">Co.</abbr> 1872. Only 200
copies of this valuable work were issued, it is consequently
very difficult to procure. Most literary frauds have been
exposed, and not a few of the forgers have been punished.
Chatterton and Shapira committed suicide, and Vrain-Lucas
was sent to prison for two years, and fined 500 francs.</p>

<p>A writer in the <cite>Daily News</cite> (July 17, 1886) observed:
“The motives of the Literary Forger seem obscure to plain
people. He has nothing to gain by it all, they say; he
does not make money, like the forger of a cheque; he can
seldom sell his forgery to advantage, as the latest biblical
forger, Shapira, of the sham manuscript gospel, discovered.
He merely poisons the very wells of history and throws
doubt on all original “sources.” People who reason thus
forget that every artist takes joy in his art, and that all
art is imitation. The art of the forger is to imitate ancient
manuscripts and inscriptions. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Art pour l’art</i> is his
motto. He revels in his own cleverness and power of
deceiving others. This is his reward. Thus a famous
French archæologist, now dead, took in his own father with
some sham Greek inscriptions. Thus William Ireland
went on writing Shakespearian autographs, and even
Shakespearian manuscript plays, chiefly to satisfy the most
tricky sense of humour, and delight in the absurdities of
learned men. Probably enough Joe Smith began his
Mormon Bible with no serious thought of founding a
religion, but merely, as other literary forgers used, for the
fun of the thing. Sooner or later these things are found
out. They amuse the learned, and no great harm is done.
But perhaps the jester Rabelais did not see the jest when
he was beguiled into publishing, with grave and learned
notes, a classical manuscript which was really the work of
two of his contemporaries. These clever ghosts must
chuckle still over the trick they played the author of
“Pantagruel.” A meaner joke was passed on Meursius,
whose respectable name is inextricably associated with a
peculiarly abominable Latin work, attributed to him by its
actual author, who thus gratified a spite of long standing.
Literary forgers are the very Pucks of letters, and all
honest men will hope they find their deserts in a Hades of
their own.”</p>

<p>The approaching completion of the sixth and
last volume of <cite>Parodies</cite> has by no means exhausted
the materials which, for five and twenty
years past, I have been accumulating. Indeed
the subject is inexhaustible, but having given
all the best parodies of English and American
writers, it only remains now to mention others
which were either too long, or too dull, to find a
home herein, and to refer briefly to some of the
principal Foreign travesties.</p>

<p>Only the true book hunter can appreciate the pleasures I
have experienced in the never ending search for parodies and
burlesques. The difficulty in obtaining some particular
volumes, not to be found in the British Museum Library,
which might (and sometimes did) turn up in some out-of-the-way
old book shop. The delight with which they were
carried home, collated, cleaned, patched and mended, to be
finally packed off to Zaehnsdorf who clothes them in all the
glory of calf and gilt, artistically, as his name does warrant.</p>

<p>In walking tours in England, in holiday trips on the Continent,
and even in the few spare moments stolen to turn
aside from the noise and bustle of London city into back
streets and dingy alleys; in pawnbrokers, and in secondhand
furniture shops, aye, even in rag and waste paper shops,
have been gathered up little, dirty, torn odd volumes to add
to my store, my beloved Parody Collection. Thus have
materials been gathered for such a Collection of Literary
trifles and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i> as has never yet been published.</p>

<p><span class="sc">London</span>, dear old London! is the paradise of the book
hunter, and of the book worm; of the one who buys books,
and of the other, who merely reads them. Here all tastes
and all purses may be gratified; the rare and costly volumes
of the King of Collectors, Bernard Quaritch; the humble
“<cite>All at 2d. in this Box</cite>;” the first editions as collected by
Elkin Mathews; or the cheap, but curious volumes to be
found in the long book room of honest, kindly John
Salkeld in the Clapham Road, whose catalogues (good as
they are), but faintly express the wonderful knowledge of
books and men he possesses.</p>

<p>Next, after London, come the quiet little book stores of
the old Cathedral cities, such as Exeter and Canterbury;
here, if theology is a trifle too obtrusive, the dealer will soon
gauge your appetite, and provide a fitting meal. Then, I
would say <em>Paris</em>, but the Paris of to-day is, in this respect,
vastly inferior to Paris under the Empire. Then, a stroll
along the quays and boulevards led to good sport, for the
game was plentiful, and ridiculously cheap. The element
of cheapness remains, but the true literary flavour is wanting.
Thousands of books, that are <em>not</em> books, school and prize
books, old almanacs, dreary directories, medical reports,
and soiled copies of trashy novels. These form the bulk.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Parodie, Monsieur? La Parodie n’existe plus. Il y
a trente ans qu’elle est morte dans la France</i>,” was the remark
made to me lately by a bookseller in the Galérie D’Orléans.
It is but too true, the literary sarcasm, and the pleasant
malice of the good old fashioned parody seem indeed to be
dead in France.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ils se moquent de tous, mais ils ne plaisantent pas</i>,”
said another dealer speaking of their authors, and so it happens
that in my private collection, but a poor hundred or so
of volumes are of French parentage, and the titles of some
of these are all that is fit to be read, unless by an enthusiastic
student of Rabelais.</p>

<p>No mention was made in the prospectus of “Parodies”
that Foreign parodies would be included, but a few brief
notes as to the principal continental examples may be given,
followed by such English works on the subject as have not
already been described.</p>

<p class="center larger big">French Parodies and
Burlesques.</p>

<p>The very first book of reference to be mentioned under
this head is <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Parodie, chez les Grecs, chez les Romains,
et chez les Modernes</cite>. Par Octave Delepierre. Londres:
Trubner &amp; Cie, 1870. This contains a great deal of information,
but it is far from complete.</p>

<p>In <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Curiosités Littéraires</cite> par Ludovic Lalanne
(Paris, 1857) is a chapter, entitled <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du Genre Burlesque</cite> in
which there is considerable information on Parody in
general, and French parody in particular. The first piece
mentioned is <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Passion de Notre-Seigneur Jésus Christ</cite>,
en vers burlesques, published in 1649; then come the works
of Sarrasin, and of Assouci, the latter wrote <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ovide en belle

burlesque translations of parts of Virgil’s great poem.</p>

The author says in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avant-propos</i>:&mdash;“J’ose me flatter
que Monsieur de Voltaire ne me sçaura point mauvais

even the names of the characters being too foul to reprint.
Delepierre says it was written by M. de Combles, and
that it was reprinted in 1853 in a small volume with an
unmentionable title. The original edition is very rare.</p>

<p>These burlesques are principally based on French tragedies

<p>Voltaire’s tragedy <cite>Semiramis</cite> was burlesqued under the

<p>It will be readily understood that the gross legends of
the Heathen Mythology present topics likely to meet
with congenial treatment from a French author and
artists, and that consequently this work (although very
laughable) is not largely used in ladies boarding schools.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo was nothing if not original. He found
the French drama restricted by old-fashioned rules, and
its poetry cramped and conventional. He selected
new metres, and adapted his style to the subjects, relinquishing
the solemn but monotonous measure in which
Racine, Corneille, and Voltaire had composed their classic
tragedies. He did not disdain to press uncouth polysyllables
into service when the necessities of rhyming
seemed to require it. His style was funnily parodied in
the <span class="lock">lines&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Atticism of French taste had never been favourable
to versification of this kind; and if Victor Hugo had
been nothing but an eccentric innovator he would have
failed completely. But Victor Hugo wrote great things,
and the vagaries of his style were the natural expressions
of an original mind; they were not the result of studied
affectation. His works in prose, in poetry, and the drama
suffered from enthusiastic imitators and professional
perverters. His plays have been persistently burlesqued,
his tragedy <cite>Marie Tudor</cite> was parodied under various
titles, as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Marie, tu ronfles!” “Marie Dort-tu?”
“Marie tu dors encore,”</span> and “Marionette.” His <cite>Angelo</cite>
was burlesqued, as “Cornaro, Tyran pas doux,” his
<cite>Ruy Blas</cite> as “Ruy Blag,” and as “Ruy Black” by
Charles Gabet, played at the Folies Bergères April 13,
1872, and as “Ruy Blas d’en Face,” also played in Paris
in 1872.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">ENGLISH BURLESQUE <br />
TRANSLATIONS OF THE CLASSICS.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Not Theatrical.</i>)</p>

<p>A list of the principal English translations of
the ancient classics is given below in the following
order: Anacreon, Aristophanes, Aristotle,
Æsop, Homer, Horace, Lucian, Ovid and
Virgil.</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>Anacreon in Dublin</cite>, with Notes. 1814. Satirical Parodies,
dedicated to Lord Byron.</p>

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>The British Birds.</cite> A communication from the Ghost of
Aristophanes. By Mortimer Collins. London. The

<p class="hangingleft"><cite>Homer Travestie</cite>, a Burlesque Translation of Homer, in
Hudibrastic verse. By Thomas Bridges.</p>

<p>Booksellers almost invariably catalogue this as “a work
full of humour, but which often transgresses the bounds
of decency,” a stolen phrase which very inadequately
describes its coarseness. The first volume of this translation
appeared in 1762 with the facetious title “<cite>A New
Translation of Homer’s Iliad</cite>, adapted to the capacity of
Honest English Roast Beef and Pudding Eaters, by
Caustic Barebones, a broken apothecary.”</p>

Doyle). London. “Pall Mall Gazette” Office, 1887.
Fifteen very humorous plates to illustrate Homer’s Iliad.</p>

Notes, and Notes upon Notes; Done in the Bentleian
Stile and Manner. London. Bernard Lintott. 1712.

Canori.</span> Henricus Drury, A.M. Cambridge. Parker
and Son. 1841.</p>

<p>This contains Latin versions of all the most celebrated
short English poems, including Gray’s Elegy, the Burial of
Sir John Moore, and some nursery rhymes.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Classics mention must be made of a
curious branch of poetry entitled <cite>Macaronic verse</cite>.
Examples of this, and many of them very ingenious, are
to be found in <cite>Poetical Ingenuities and Eccentricities</cite>
selected by William T. Dobson. London. Chatto and
Windus, 1882.</p>

<p>Octave Delepierre also wrote several essays on the
subject, the principal being entitled <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Littérature Macaronique</cite>.</p>

<p>One of the best of these literary curiosities is a
small pamphlet (to be had of Mr. J. Vincent, Oxford,)
<span class="lock">entitled&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<cite>Uniomachia</cite>; a Greek-Latin Macaronic Poem,” by
Thomas Jackson, M.A. This was originally published
in 1833, with a translation into English verse (after the
manner of the late ingenious Mr. Alexander Pope),
styled “The Battle at the Union.”</p>

<p>Another humorous pamphlet also published by Vincent,
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viae per Angliam Ferro Stratae</cite>, and written by Mr. Fanshawe
of Baliol College in 1841, was a comical skit on the
early railways, in Latin hexameters.</p>

<p>Many Macaronic poems have appeared in <cite>Punch</cite> from
time to time, to the great delight and amusement of
classical scholars. The following, published in March,
1852, is a fine example of this class of learned <span class="lock">frivolity:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Oldest Classical Burlesque.</span></p>

<p><cite>Batrachomyomachia</cite> is the cheerful title of the oldest
burlesque extant, and even if we do not accept the tradition
which assigns its composition to Homer, we may
safely consider it to be the earliest of the many travesties
of the heroic style of the “Iliad” and “Odyssey.”</p>

<p>According to Plutarch, the real author was one Pigres,
of Halicarnassus, who flourished during the Persian war.
Statius conjectures that Homer wrote it when a youth, as
a trial of his poetical powers; whilst the author of one of
finest English translations of Homer, George Chapman,
asserts that the work was composed in his old age; when,
disgusted with the neglect and ingratitude of his contemporaries,
he set to work to show that he could elevate
and dignify the wars and struggles of insignificant animals,
as he had previously described the heroic actions of the
Greeks and Trojans.</p>

<p>Samuel Wesley published an English translation of the
<cite>Batrachomyomachia</cite>, which he called “The Iliad in a
Nutshell.” He speaks of it “as perhaps the best, as well
as the oldest burlesque in the world.”</p>

<p>The following is a synopsis of the plot of this poem,
generally known as the <cite>Battle of the Frogs and Mice</cite>.</p>

<p>A mouse, having just escaped the pursuit of a hungry
weasel, stays by the edge of a pond to drink and take
breath, when a frog swims up, enters into conversation,
and invites the mouse to visit his abode. The mouse consents,
and mounts upon the back of the frog, who swims
into the middle of the pool. Suddenly an otter appears,
the terrified frog dives to the bottom, leaving the mouse
to struggle with the foaming billows. Unable to reach the
shore, he sinks to a watery grave; a comrade who had
arrived at the brink too late to be of service, hastens to
relate the pitiful tale to a council of his fellows, and war
is at once declared against the Frogs.</p>

<p>Jupiter and the gods deliberate in Olympus on the issue
of the contest. Mars and Minerva decline personal interference,
partly from awe inspired by such mighty combatants,
and partly from the ill will they bear towards the
contending parties.</p>

<p>A band of mosquitoes sound the war-alarum with their
trumpets, and, after a bloody engagement, the frogs are
defeated with great slaughter. Jupiter, sympathising
with their fate, endeavours in vain by his thunders to intimidate
the victors from further pursuit. The rescue of
the frogs is at last effected by an army of landcrabs, which
marches up, attacks the mice, and drives them from the
field in great disorder.</p>

<p>Wesley’s translation of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i> is a specimen of
the mock-heroic style which runs through the <span class="lock">original:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">The Muses, knowing all things, list not show</div>
<div class="i2">The wailing for the Dead and Funeral Rites,</div>
<div class="i1">To blameless Ethiopians must they go</div>
<div class="i2">To feast with Jove for twelve succeeding nights.</div>
<div class="i1">Therefore abrupt thus end they. Let suffice</div>
<div class="i2">The gods’ august assembly to relate,</div>
<div class="i1">Heroic Frogs and Demigods of Mice,</div>
<div class="i2">Troxartes’ vengeance and Pelides’ fate.</div>
<div class="i1">Hosts routed, lakes of gore, and hills of slain,</div>

<p>If you take the mean of an isosceles triangle, bisect it at
one and an eighth, giving a centrifugal force of three to
one; then describe a gradient on its periphery of ¾ to the
square inch, throwing off the right angles from the previously
ascertained square root, you form a rhomboid whose
base is equal to the circumference of a circle of twice its
own cubic contents. These premisses being granted it
stands to reason that it is impossible for a steam engine of

without tearing the piston cock off the main boiler,
even with the rotation derived from a double stuffing box,

<span class="sc">n</span> the following Table a rather wide
interpretation has been given to the
word <em>Burlesque</em>, so that some of J. R.
Planché’s witty extravaganzas have
been included, and a few even of the
clever pantomime openings written
by the late Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The
object aimed at being to insert particulars of
every <em>Dramatic</em> production which professed to
be a Burlesque, or a Travestie of any well-known
Play, Novel, Poem, or Poetical Legend.</p>

<p>Probably some thousands of Burlesques have
been performed which have never attained the
dignity of print, and in the following pages will
be found many Burlesques which have never
been publicly acted, although written in
dramatic form.</p>

<p>I wish to express my sincere thanks to my
esteemed friend Mr. T. F. Dillon Croker for the
great assistance he has rendered in this compilation.
Not only was his curious dramatic
library generously placed at my disposal, but
he also undertook to revise the proof sheets,
his intimate knowledge of theatrical history enabling
him to make numerous valuable suggestions.
I have also to thank Mr. F. Howell for
the loan of many early burlesques, and to mention
that in the verification of dates the <cite>Era
Almanacks</cite> have been of great service. It is to
be regretted that this useful publication was
not started until 1868. Long may it flourish!</p>

<p>In a Table containing nearly eight hundred
entries, and the first of its kind ever compiled,
it is almost inevitable that some errors and
omissions should occur. Mr. Samuel French,
the theatrical publisher, in answer to a politely
worded request, not only declined to give the
slightest assistance, but even refused permission
to consult any of his Play books for
the verification of a few dates. This information
is not readily accessible at the British Museum
Library, as under the peculiar method of
cataloguing there adopted, it is necessary to
know the author’s name of any work one desires
to consult. As Mr. French possesses a virtual
monopoly of the sale of modern English plays
it is to be regretted that he will not extend
a little courteous assistance to writers on
Dramatic history.</p>

<p>Mr. John Dicks, of 313, Strand, who issues
very cheap and readable reprints of old English
plays, gave me all the information in his power,
but, as yet, he has only published a few Burlesques.</p>

<p>In the Table a strictly alphabetical arrangement
of Titles has been adopted, followed by
the date and place of first performance, and in
some cases the names of the principal performers
have been given. For convenience of
reference the articles, The, Ye, A, An, Le, La,
L’, Il, have been ignored. Thus&mdash;<cite>L’Africaine</cite>
will be found under the letter A, and <cite>La Sonnambula</cite>
under the letter S.</p>

<p>Where the name of a Theatre is given, without any town,
London is to be understood.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>In his Introduction to <cite>Burlesque Plays and
Poems</cite> (G. Routledge &amp; Sons, 1885), Mr. Henry
Morley <span class="lock">observes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The word Burlesque came to us through the French
from the Italian ‘burlesco’; ‘burla’ being mockery or
raillery, and implying always an object. Burlesque must,
<cite>burlarsi di uno</cite>, mock at somebody or something, and
when intended to give pleasure it is nothing if not good-natured.
One etymologist associates the word with the
old English ‘bourd,’ a jest; the Gaelic ‘burd,’ he says,
means mockery, and ‘buirleadh,’ is language of ridicule.
Yes, and ‘burrail’ is the loud romping of children, and
‘burrall’ is weeping and wailing in a deep-toned howl.
Another etymologist takes the Italian ‘burla,’ waggery
or banter, as diminutive from the Latin ‘burra,’ which
means a rough hair, but is used by Ausonius in the sense
of a jest. That etymology no doubt fits burlesque to a
hair, but, like Launce’s sweetheart, it may have more
hair than wit.”</p>

<p>There are few more amusing pieces of light
English literature than some of our early theatrical
burlesques, such as Beaumont and
Fletcher’s “Knight of the Burning Pestle,”
the Duke of Buckingham’s “Rehearsal,” Henry
Fielding’s “Tom Thumb,” Sheridan’s “The
Critic,” and Poole’s “Hamlet,” with its absurd
notes in imitation of several learned Shakespearian
commentators.</p>

<p>During the last thirty or forty years this particular
form of Dramatic Entertainment has
been specially cultivated, and at the Strand,
Royalty, and Gaiety Theatres, in London, the
“Sacred Lamp of Burlesque” has been kept
alight by the productions of such prolific and
humorous writers as Gilbert A. à Beckett,
Francis Talfourd, Leicester Buckingham,
Albert Smith, William Brough, Robert Reece,
Stirling Coyne, H. B. Farnie, Henry J. Byron,
and F. C. Burnand. Much has been written
for and against dramatic burlesque, and it may
be said, without fear of contradiction, that
recently far less attention has been devoted to
the literary merits of the productions than to
the scenery and dresses. The humour of the
actors being considered as of less importance
than a dazzling mise-en-scene with a host of
pretty half-dressed ballet girls.</p>

<p>The following articles are of interest in connection
with modern dramatic burlesque.</p>

<p><cite>Is Burlesque Art?</cite> A paper by Blanche Reives, read
before the Church and Stage Guild, October 7, 1880. The
authoress quotes thus from a letter written by Mr. W. S.
Gilbert:&mdash;“Burlesque in its higher development calls for
high intellectual power on the part of its professors.
Aristophanes, Rabelais, George Cruikshank, the authors
of the <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>, John Leech, and J. R. Planché
were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.
The form of burlesque with which modern theatre
goers are familiar, scarcely calls for criticism, it is infantile
in its folly.”</p>

“<cite>Royal Windsor</cite>” for an advertisement (<cite>affiche</cite>)?
Val Prinsep has painted something like an Artist, but (<cite>mais</cite>)
Mr. Holl has painted somebody who is something like
an Artist. What is his name? His name is (<cite>il s’appelle</cite>)
John Tenniel. It is very hot. It is crowded. When it is
crowded it is hot. How many people are there here? I do
not know: I will count them. I should like some lunch.
You can lunch at the Restaurant below. Will you lunch
there also (<cite>aussi</cite>)? With pleasure, if you will pay for both
of us (<cite>tous les deux</cite>). I have a hat, a stick, an umbrella, a
catalogue, a ticket of admission, and an appetite, but I
have no money. I am afraid (<cite>je crains</cite>) that no one will
give me luncheon. I will (<cite>je vais</cite>) go down (<cite>descendre</cite>) into

<p>Waiter! (<cite>garçon</cite>) have you some bread, some cutlets,
some beef, some preserved strawberry jam-tart (<cite>confiture

sit opposite (<cite>vis-à-vis</cite>) me. Call the Waiter, and tell him
we lunch together (<cite>ensemble</cite>).</p>

<p>The wine is good, the bread is excellent, the beef is appetising.
Excuse me one moment (<cite>un moment</cite>) I see Madame
X&mdash;&mdash; going up (<cite>monter</cite>) to the Gallery. I must (<cite>il faut</cite>)
speak to her. She has asked me to show (<cite>indiquer</cite>) her
Mrs. Jopling’s pictures and Miss Montalba’s (<cite>ceux de</cite> Mlle.
Montalba). You are coming back (<cite>de retour</cite>), are you not
(<cite>n’est-ce pas</cite>)? Yes; I shall come back.</p>

<p>Waiter! the Gentleman who was with me will come back
and pay for his own share. No, Sir (<cite>Non, Monsieur</cite>) you
must pay for the two. It is too bad; I will speak to
(<cite>m’addresser</cite>) Mr. Comyns Carr, or to Sir Coutts. All that
is nothing to me (<cite>tout ça ne me regarde pas</cite>); you have (<cite>il

two vegetables (<cite>legumes</cite>), one bottle of the best (<cite>le meilleur</cite>)
wine, two breads, two butters.</p>

<p>There is the money. I am angry. I will not give anything
(<cite>ne-rien</cite>) to the waiter. The pictures are in the
Gallery above, but his friend is no longer to be seen
(<cite>visible</cite>). Where is that gentleman (<cite>ce monsieur</cite>)? He is
gone (<cite>il est parti</cite>). Did he say when he would return? No;
he did not say when he would return. He has taken my
overcoat (<cite>par-dessus</cite>), my catalogue, and my new umbrella
(<cite>parapluie</cite>). I will hasten (<cite>me presser</cite>) to seek (<cite>chercher</cite>)
him. Another day I will look at the pictures.</p>

in the usually-received termination of this otherwise excellent
story, wherein none of the good people were made happy,
and the wicked were most inadequately punished, had
caused the author to tremble for his popularity among the
female portion of the community&mdash;who, it is well known,
will stand no liberties of that description. He has therefore
(apparently) re-written it on more orthodox principles; or
(not improbably) got somebody else to re-write it for him;
or (as is barely possible) somebody else has re-written it for
him without asking his leave. We have no means of ascertaining
the exact state of the case. The reader is requested
to form his own opinion, and let us know at his earliest convenience.&mdash;<span class="sc">Eds.

Edinburgh was not on board at the time, but he was in
command on the station, and under his directions ineffectual
efforts were made to save the vessel. These
having failed, a Court of Enquiry was held, of which it
has not been deemed prudent to publish any report. It
would obviously be exceedingly unprofessional to impute
negligence or incompetence to a Royal Duke who condescends
to accept the title and the pay of an Admiral.</p>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations, inconsistent hyphenation, or non-standard use of
apostrophes. These have been left unchanged unless indicated
below.</p>

<p>Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside down, unprinted
or partially printed letters, were corrected. Final stops missing at
the end of sentences and abbreviations were added. Duplicate letters
at line endings or page breaks were removed. Numbers 11.
and 12. were added to <a href="#command">Les Commandements de la Presse</a>.</p>

<p>Unprinted diacriticals were added to words in languages other than
English. The use of quotation marks is not standard, and generally was
not changed unless needed for clarity. Extraneous punctuation was
deleted.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to the
end of the book. There are two anchors for Footnote <a
href="#footnote_47"> [47]</a>. Anchors for <a
href="#footnote_286"> [286]</a> and <a href="#footnote_322">
[322]</a> were unprinted; anchors were added where they may
belong.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Page_56"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Street ballad</a> and its parody
are presented in sequence, not side by side.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
